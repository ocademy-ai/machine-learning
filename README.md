## **Overview**

Welcome to **Open Academy** for ML! Our target is to provide online resources for **university students and working professionals**, who are preparing for or currently involved in fields such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. The project is hosted on GitHub and is free for anyone to use and learn.

## **Goals**

The goals of this project are:

- To provide high-quality [online resources](https://github.com/Appointat/machine-learning/tree/main#How-to-Use-This-Project) that are accessible to university students who are interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
- To create a [community](https://github.com/Appointat/machine-learning#community) of students and educators who are passionate about these topics and who can collaborate to improve the project over time.
- To foster a culture of open source education, where students can learn from each other and from industry experts, and where educators can share their knowledge and expertise with a wider audience.

## **Features**

This project includes the following features:

- A curated list of [online courses](https://github.com/Appointat/machine-learning#curriculum), [tutorials](https://open-academy.github.io/machine-learning/intro.html), and other [resources](https://www.notion.so/README-md-for-Open-ML-9e8e63c05411425e838ad8dc04b7ff73) for learning about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. These resources are suitable for beginners and are organized by topic, making it easy to find what you're looking for.
- Open source [code examples and projects](https://open-academy.github.io/machine-learning/assignments/introduction.html) that demonstrate best practices in these fields. These examples are designed to help students learn by doing and can be modified and adapted for use in their own projects.
- Collaborative learning opportunities, such as hackathons and online forums, where students can work together on projects and share their knowledge with each other. These events are open to anyone who wants to participate and are a great way to meet other students who are interested in these topics.
- Guest lectures and other industry events that provide students with insights into the latest trends and developments in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. These events are hosted by industry experts and are a great way to learn about the practical applications of these fields.

### Interactive online textbook

This [Online Textbook](https://open-academy.github.io/machine-learning/intro.html) is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, from the fundamentals to the latest advanced techniques, with a focus on practical applications. It is intended for developers, data scientists, engineers, and anyone who wants to learn how to use machine learning to solve real-world problems.

It is divided into four main parts.

- Chap 1 covers the prerequisites, including an introduction to Python programming and its advanced concepts.
- Chap 2 focuses on the Data Science lifecycle, from data acquisition to data visualization, and introduces the best practices for working with data in the cloud.
- Chap 3 covers the fundamentals of Machine Learning, including regression, classification, and model deployment.
- Chap 4 covers advanced Machine Learning techniques, such as Clustering, Ensemble :earning, and Deep Learning.
- …

Each chapter includes **theoretical concepts**, **hands-on exercises**, and **real-world examples** to help you develop a solid understanding of the topic. By the end of the textbook, you will have the knowledge and skills to build and deploy Machine Learning models in a production environment.
