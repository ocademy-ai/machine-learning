    "## Probability and random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses how probable an **event** is. It is defined as a number of positive outcomes (that lead to the event), divided by a total number of outcomes, given that all outcomes are equally probable. For example, when we roll a dice, the probability that we get an even number is $3/6 = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about events, we use **random variables**. For example, the random variable that represents a number obtained when rolling a dice would take values from $1$ to $6$. A set of numbers from $1$ to $6$ is called **sample space**. We can talk about the probability of a random variable taking a certain value, for example, $P(X=3)=1/6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variable in the previous example is called **discrete** because it has a countable sample space, i.e. there are separate values that can be enumerated. There are cases when sample space is a range of real numbers or the whole set of real numbers. Such variables are called **continuous**. A good example is a time when the bus arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of discrete random variables, it is easy to describe the probability of each event by a function $P(X)$. For each value $s$ from sample space $S$ it will give a number from $0$ to $1$, such that the sum of all values of $P(X=s)$ for all events would be $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most well-known discrete distribution is a **uniform distribution**, in which there is a sample space of $N$ elements, with an equal probability of $1/N$ for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more difficult to describe the probability distribution of a continuous variable, with values drawn from some interval $[a,b]$, or the whole set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. Consider the case of bus arrival time. In fact, for each exact arrival time $t$, the probability of a bus arriving at exactly that time is $0$!"

It is often applied to categorical data, such as colors. Consider a situation where we have two groups of people - some that strongly prefer red, and others who prefer blue. If we code colors by numbers, the mean value for a favorite color would be somewhere in the orange-green spectrum, which does not indicate the actual preference for either group. However, the mode would be either one of the colors, or both colors, if the number of people voting for them is equal (in this case we call the sample **multimodal**).\n",

For example, a sequence of people's weights can be considered to be a sequence of values drawn from some random variable.

We compute the deviation of both variables from their mean values, and then the product of those deviations. If both variables deviate together, the product would always be a positive value, which would add up to positive covariance.
