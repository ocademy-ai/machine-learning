    "Market trends tell us that by 2022, 1-in-3 large organizations will buy and sell their data through online [Marketplaces and Exchanges](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/). As **app developers**, we'll find it easier and cheaper to integrate data-driven insights and algorithm-driven automation into daily user experiences. But as AI becomes pervasive, we'll also need to understand the potential harms caused by the [weaponization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHs8SA1qpk) of such algorithms at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trends also indicate that we will create and consume over [180 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) of data by 2025. As **Data Scientists**, this gives us unprecedented levels of access to personal data. This means we can build behavioral profiles of users and influence decision-making in ways that create an [illusion of free choice](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-illusion-of-choice-5224973) while potentially nudging users towards outcomes we prefer. It also raises broader questions on data privacy and user protections.\n",

    "In this section, we'll explore the fascinating area of data ethics - from core concepts and challenges, to case studies and applied AI concepts like governance - that help establish an ethics culture in teams and organizations that work with data and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by understanding the basic terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"ethics\" comes from the [Greek word \"ethikos\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) (and its root \"ethos\") meaning _character or moral nature_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethics** is about the shared values and moral principles that govern our behavior in society. Ethics is based not on laws but on widely accepted norms of what is \"right vs. wrong\". However, ethical considerations can influence corporate governance initiatives and government regulations that create more incentives for compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data ethics** is a [new branch of ethics](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0360#sec-1) that \"studies and evaluates moral problems related to _data, algorithms and corresponding practices_\". Here, **\"data\"** focuses on actions related to generation, recording, curation, processing dissemination, sharing, and usage, **\"algorithms\"** focuses on AI, agents, Machine Learning, and robots, and **\"practices\"** focuses on topics like responsible innovation, programming, hacking and ethics codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applied ethics** is the [practical application of moral considerations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_ethics). It's the process of actively investigating ethical issues in the context of _real-world actions, products, and processes_, and taking corrective measures to make that these remain aligned with our defined ethical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethics culture** is about [_operationalizing_ applied ethics](https://hbr.org/2019/05/how-to-design-an-ethical-organization) to make sure that our ethical principles and practices are adopted in a consistent and scalable manner across the entire organization. Successful ethics cultures define organization-wide ethical principles, provide meaningful incentives for compliance, and reinforce ethics norms by encouraging and amplifying desired behaviors at every level of the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethics concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll discuss concepts like **shared values** (principles) and **ethical challenges** (problems) for data ethics - and explore **case studies** that help you understand these concepts in real-world contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data ethics strategy begins by defining _ethical principles_ - the \"shared values\" that describe acceptable behaviors, and guide compliant actions, in our data & AI projects. You can define these at an individual or team level. However, most large organizations outline these in an _ethical AI_ mission statement or framework that is defined at corporate levels and enforced consistently across all teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Microsoft's [Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) mission statement reads: _\"We are committed to the advancement of AI-driven by ethical principles that put people first\"_ - identifying 6 ethical principles in the framework below:"

    "### Ethics challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have ethical principles defined, the next step is to evaluate our data and AI actions to see if they align with those shared values. Think about your actions in two categories: _data collection_ and _algorithm design_.\n",
    "\n",
    "With data collection, actions will likely involve **personal data** or personally identifiable information (PII) for identifiable living individuals. This includes [diverse items of non-personal data](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en) that _collectively_ identify an individual. Ethical challenges can relate to _data privacy_, _data ownership_, and related topics like _informed consent_ and _intellectual property rights_ for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With algorithm design, actions will involve collecting & curating **datasets**, then using them to train & deploy **data models** that predict outcomes or automate decisions in real-world contexts. Ethical challenges can arise from _dataset bias_, _data quality_ issues, _unfairness_, and _misrepresentation_ in algorithms - including some issues that are systemic in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, ethics challenges highlight areas where our actions may encounter conflict with our shared values. To detect, mitigate, minimize, or eliminate, these concerns - we need to ask moral \"yes/no\" questions related to our actions, then take corrective actions as needed. Let's take a look at some ethical challenges and the moral questions they raise:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1\\. Data ownership**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection often involves personal data that can identify the data subjects. [Data ownership](https://permission.io/blog/data-ownership) is about _control_ and [_user rights_](https://permission.io/blog/data-ownership) related to the creation, processing, and dissemination of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moral questions we need to ask are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who owns the data? (user or organization)\n",
    "* What rights do data subjects have? (ex: access, erasure, portability)\n",
    "* What rights do organizations have? (ex: rectify malicious user reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2\\. Informed consent**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Informed consent](https://legaldictionary.net/informed-consent/) defines the act of users agreeing to an action (like data collection) with a _full understanding_ of relevant facts including the purpose, potential risks, and alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did the user (data subject) give permission for data capture and usage?\n",
    "* Did the user understand the purpose for which that data was captured?\n",
    "* Did the user understand the potential risks of their participation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3\\. Intellectual property**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) refers to intangible creations resulting from the human initiative, that may _have economic value_ to individuals or businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did the collected data have economic value to a user or business?\n",
    "* Does the **user** have intellectual property here?\n",
    "* Does the **organization** have intellectual property here?\n",
    "* If these rights exist, how are we protecting them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**4\\. Data privacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Data privacy](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/what-is-data-privacy/) or information privacy refers to the preservation of user privacy and protection of user identity with respect to personally identifiable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is users' (personal) data secured against hacks and leaks?\n",
    "* Is users' data accessible only to authorized users and contexts?\n",
    "* Is users' anonymity preserved when data is shared or disseminated?\n",
    "* Can a user be de-identified from anonymized datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "**5\\. Right to be forgotten**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) or [Right to erasure](https://www.gdpreu.org/right-to-be-forgotten/) provides additional personal data protection to users. Specifically, it gives users the right to request deletion or removal of personal data from Internet searches and other locations, _under specific circumstances_ - allowing them a fresh start online without past actions being held against them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does the system allow data subjects to request erasure?\n",
    "* Should the withdrawal of user consent trigger automated erasure?\n",
    "* Was data collected without consent or by unlawful means?\n",
    "* Are we compliant with government regulations for data privacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**6\\. Dataset bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset or [Collection bias](http://researcharticles.com/index.php/bias-in-data-collection-in-research/) is about selecting a _non-representative_ subset of data for algorithm development, creating potential unfairness in result outcomes for diverse groups. Types of bias include selection or sampling bias, volunteer bias, and instrument bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did we recruit a representative set of data subjects?\n",
    "* Did we test our collected or curated dataset for various biases?\n",
    "* Can we mitigate or remove any discovered biases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**7\\. Data quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Data Quality](https://lakefs.io/data-quality-testing/) looks at the validity of the curated dataset used to develop our algorithms, checking to see if features and records meet requirements for the level of accuracy and consistency needed for our AI purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did we capture valid _features_ for our use case?\n",
    "* Was data captured _consistently_ across diverse data sources?\n",
    "* Is the dataset _complete_ for diverse conditions or scenarios?\n",
    "* Is information captured _accurately_ in reflecting reality?\n",
    "\n",
    "**8\\. Algorithm fairness**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Algorithm fairness](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-algorithm-fairness-3182e161cf9f) checks to see if the algorithm design systematically discriminates against specific subgroups of data subjects leading to [potential harms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-fairness-ml) in _allocation_ (where resources are denied or withheld from that group) and _quality of service_ (where AI is not as accurate for some subgroups as it is for others).\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did we evaluate model accuracy for diverse subgroups and conditions?\n",
    "* Did we scrutinize the system for potential harm (e.g., stereotyping)?\n",
    "* Can we revise data or retrain models to mitigate identified harms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore resources like [AI Fairness checklists](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4t6dA) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9\\. Misrepresentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Data misrepresentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/misrepresentation) is about asking whether we are communicating insights from honestly reported data in a deceptive manner to support a desired narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are we reporting incomplete or inaccurate data?\n",
    "* Are we visualizing data in a manner that drives misleading conclusions?\n",
    "* Are we using selective statistical techniques to manipulate outcomes?\n",
    "* Are there alternative explanations that may offer a different conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**10\\. Free choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Illusion of Free Choice](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-illusion-of-choice) occurs when system \"choice architectures\" use decision-making algorithms to nudge people towards taking a preferred outcome while seeming to give them options and control. These [dark patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) can cause social and economic harm to users. Because user decisions impact behavior profiles, these actions potentially drive future choices that can amplify or extend the impact of these harms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did the user understand the implications of making that choice?\n",
    "* Was the user aware of (alternative) choices and the pros & cons of each?\n",
    "* Can the user reverse an automated or influenced choice later?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case studies\n",
    "\n",
    "To put these ethical challenges in real-world contexts, it helps to look at case studies that highlight the potential harms and consequences to individuals and society, when such ethics violations are overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Ethics Challenge | Case Study  |\n",
    "|--- |--- |\n",
    "| **Informed consent** | 1972 - [Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study) - African American men who participated in the study were promised free medical care _but deceived_ by researchers who failed to inform subjects of their diagnosis or about availability of treatment. Many subjects died & partners or children were affected; the study lasted 40 years. |\n",
    "| **Data privacy** |  2007 - The [Netflix data prize](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/) provided researchers with _10M anonymized movie rankings from 50K customers_ to help improve recommendation algorithms. However, researchers were able to correlate anonymized data with personally-identifiable data in _external datasets_ (e.g., IMDb comments) - effectively \"de-anonymizing\" some Netflix subscribers.|\n",
    "| **Collection bias**  | 2013 - The City of Boston [developed Street Bump](https://www.boston.gov/transportation/street-bump), an app that let citizens report potholes, giving the city better roadway data to find and fix issues. However, [people in lower income groups had less access to cars and phones](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data), making their roadway issues invisible in this app. Developers worked with academics to _equitable access and digital divides_ issues for fairness. |\n",
    "| **Algorithmic fairness**  | 2018 - The MIT [Gender Shades Study](http://gendershades.org/overview.html) evaluated the accuracy of gender classification AI products, exposing gaps in accuracy for women and persons of color. A [2019 Apple Card](https://www.wired.com/story/the-apple-card-didnt-see-genderand-thats-the-problem/) seemed to offer less credit to women than men. Both illustrated issues in algorithmic bias leading to socio-economic harms.|\n",
    "| **Data misrepresentation** | 2020 - The [Georgia Department of Public Health released COVID-19 charts](https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-us-response-trump/2020/5/18/21262265/georgia-covid-19-cases-declining-reopening) that appeared to mislead citizens about trends in confirmed cases with non-chronological ordering on the x-axis. This illustrates misrepresentation through visualization tricks. |\n",
    "| **Illusion of free choice** | 2020 - Learning app [ABCmouse paid $10M to settle an FTC complaint](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/04/abcmouse-10-million-ftc-settlement/) where parents were trapped into paying for subscriptions they couldn't cancel. This illustrates dark patterns in choice architectures, where users were nudged towards potentially harmful choices. |\n",
    "| **Data privacy & user rights** | 2021 - Facebook [Data Breach](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/986005820/after-data-breach-exposes-530-million-facebook-says-it-will-not-notify-users) exposed data from 530M users, resulting in a $5B settlement to the FTC. It however refused to notify users of the breach violating user rights around data transparency and access. |"

    "\n",
    "Ethics is about defining shared values and doing the right thing _voluntarily_. **Compliance** is about _following the law_ if and where defined. **Governance** broadly covers all the ways in which organizations operate to enforce ethical principles and comply with established laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, governance takes two forms within organizations. First, it's about defining **ethical AI** principles and establishing practices to operationalize adoption across all AI-related projects in the organization. Second, it's about complying with all government-mandated **data protection regulations** for regions it operates in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of data protection and privacy regulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1974`, [US Privacy Act](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974) - regulates _federal govt._ collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.\n",
    "* `1996`, [US Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html) - protects personal health data.\n",
    "* `1998`, [US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule) - protects the data privacy of children under 13.\n",
    "* `2018`, [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) - provides user rights, data protection, and privacy.\n",
    "* `2018`, [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) gives consumers more _rights_ over their (personal) data.\n",
    "* `2021`, China's [Personal Information Protection Law](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20/) just passed, creating one of the strongest online data privacy regulations worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸš¨ The European Union defined GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) remains one of the most influential data privacy regulations today. Did you know it also defines [8 user rights](https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/blog/8-user-rights-gdpr) to protect citizens' digital privacy and personal data? Learn about what these are, and why they matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics culture\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there remains an intangible gap between _compliance_ (doing enough to meet \"the letter of the law\") and addressing [systemic issues](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-ethics/home/week/4) (like ossification, information asymmetry, and distributional unfairness) that can speed up the weaponization of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter requires [collaborative approaches to defining ethics cultures](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-ai-ethics-requires-a-culture-driven-approach-26f451afa29f) that build emotional connections and consistent shared values _across organizations_ in the industry. This calls for more [formalized data ethics cultures](https://www.codeforamerica.org/news/formalizing-an-ethical-data-culture/) in organizations - allowing _anyone_ to [pull the Andon cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)) (to raise ethics concerns early in the process) and making _ethical assessments_ (e.g., in hiring) a core criterion for team formation in AI projects.\n",

    "## Your turn! ðŸš€\n",
    "\n",
    "[Write a data ethics case study](https://static-1300131294.cos.qp-shanghai.myqcloud.com/assignments/data-science/write-a-data-ethics-case-study.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self study\n",
    "\n",
    "Courses and books help with understanding core ethics concepts and challenges, while case studies and tools help with applied ethics practices in real-world contexts. Here are a few resources to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Machine Learning For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/blob/main/1-Introduction/3-fairness/README.md) - section on Fairness, from Microsoft.\n",
    "* [Principles of Responsible AI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/responsible-ai-principles/) - free learning path from Microsoft Learn.\n",
    "* [Ethics and Data Science](https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/0636920203964) - O'Reilly EBook (M. Loukides, H. Mason et. al)\n",
    "* [Data Science Ethics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-ethics#syllabus) - online course from the University of Michigan.\n",
    "* [Ethics Unwrapped](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/case-studies) - case studies from the University of Texas.\n",
    "\n",
