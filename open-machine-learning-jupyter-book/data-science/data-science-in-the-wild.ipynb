    "\n",
    "We're almost at the end of this learning journey!\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with definitions of data science and ethics, explored various tools & techniques for data analysis and visualization, reviewed the data science lifecycle, and looked at scaling and automating data science workflows with cloud computing services. So, you're probably wondering: _\"How exactly do I map all these learnings to real-world contexts?\"_\n",

    "\n",
    "Thanks to the democratization of AI, developers are now finding it easier to design and integrate AI-driven decision-making and data-driven insights into user experiences and development workflows. Here are a few examples of how data science is \"applied\" to real-world applications across the industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google Flu Trends](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/can-learn-epic-failure-google-flu-trends/) used data science to correlate search terms with flu trends. While the approach had flaws, it raised awareness of the possibilities (and challenges) of data-driven healthcare predictions.\n",
    "* [UPS Routing Predictions](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/21/139000/how-ups-uses-ai-to-outsmart-bad-weather/) - explains how UPS uses data science and machine learning to predict optimal routes for delivery, taking into account weather conditions, traffic patterns, delivery deadlines, and more.\n",
    "* [NYC Taxicab Route Visualization](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/) - data gathered using [Freedom Of Information Laws](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/) helped visualize a day in the life of NYC cabs, helping us understand how they navigate the busy city, the money they make, and the duration of trips over each 24 hours.\n",
    "* [Uber Data Science Workbench](https://eng.uber.com/dsw/) - uses data (on pickup & dropoff locations, trip duration, preferred routes, etc.) gathered from millions of uber trips *daily* to build a data analytics tool to help with pricing, safety, fraud detection, and navigation decisions.\n",
    "* [Sports Analytics](https://towardsdatascience.com/scope-of-analytics-in-sports-world-37ed09c39860) - focuses on _predictive analytics_ (team and player analysis - think [Moneyball](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/moneyball-proves-importance-big-data-big-ideas/) - and fan management) and _data visualization_ (team & fan dashboards, games, etc.) with applications like talent scouting, sports gambling, and inventory/venue management.\n",
    "* [Data Science in Banking](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-in-banking/) - highlights the value of data science in the finance industry with applications ranging from risk modeling and fraud detection, to customer segmentation, real-time prediction, and recommender systems. Predictive analytics also drive critical measures like [credit scores](https://dzone.com/articles/using-big-data-and-predictive-analytics-for-credit).\n",
    "* [Data Science in Healthcare](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-in-healthcare/) - highlights applications like medical imaging (e.g., MRI, X-Ray, CT-Scan), genomics (DNA sequencing), drug development (risk assessment, success prediction), predictive analytics (patient care & supply logistics), disease tracking & prevention, etc."

    "While real-world applications often focus on industry use cases at scale, _research_ applications and projects can be useful from two perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _innovation opportunities_ - explore rapid prototyping of advanced concepts and testing of user experiences for next-generation applications.\n",

So what do research projects look like and how can they make an impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one example - the [MIT Gender Shades Study](http://gendershades.org/overview.html) from Joy Buolamwini (MIT Media Labs) with a [signature research paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf) co-authored with Timnit Gebru (then at Microsoft Research) that focused on,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What:** The objective of the research project was to _evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets_ based on gender and skin type. \n",
    "* **Why:** Facial analysis is used in areas like law enforcement, airport security, hiring systems and more - contexts where inaccurate classifications (e.g., due to bias) can cause potential economic and social harm to affected individuals or groups. Understanding (and eliminating or mitigating) biases is key to fairness in usage.\n",
    "* **How:** Researchers recognized that existing benchmarks used predominantly lighter-skinned subjects, and curated a new data set (1000+ images) that was _more balanced_ by gender and skin type. The data set was used to evaluate the accuracy of three gender classification products (from Microsoft, IBM & Face++).\n",
    "\n",
    "Results showed that though overall classification accuracy was good, there was a noticeable difference in error rates between various subgroups - with **misgendering** being higher for females or persons with darker skin types, indicative of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Outcomes:** Raised awareness that data science needs more _representative datasets_ (balanced subgroups) and more _inclusive teams_ (diverse backgrounds) to recognize and eliminate or mitigate such biases earlier in AI solutions. Research efforts like this are also instrumental in many organizations defining principles and practices for _responsible AI_ to improve fairness across their AI products and processes.\n",

For instance, _can we predict the season in which a poem was authored by analyzing its tone or sentiment_ - and what does this tell us about the author's state of mind over the relevant period?\n",
