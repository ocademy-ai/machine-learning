    "## What is Azure Machine Learning(ML)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure cloud platform is more than 200 products and cloud services designed to help you bring new solutions to life. Data scientists expend a lot of effort exploring and pre-processing data and trying various types of model-training algorithms to produce accurate models. These tasks are time-consuming and often make inefficient use of expensive compute hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Azure ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&ocid=AID3041109) is a cloud-based platform for building and operating Machine Learning solutions in Azure. It includes a wide range of features and capabilities that help data scientists prepare data, train models, publish predictive services, and monitor their usage. Most importantly, it helps them to increase their efficiency by automating many of the time-consuming tasks associated with training models; and it enables them to use cloud-based compute resources that scale effectively, to handle large volumes of data while incurring costs only when actually used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure ML provides all the tools developers and data scientists need for their Machine Learning workflows. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure Machine Learning Studio**: it is a web portal in Azure Machine Learning for low-code and no-code options for model training, deployment, automation, tracking and asset management. The studio integrates with the Azure Machine Learning SDK for a seamless experience.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebooks**: quickly prototype and test ML models.\n",
    "- **Azure Machine Learning Designer**: allows to drag-n-drop modules to build experiments and then deploy pipelines in a low-code environment.\n",
    "- **Automated Machine Learning UI (AutoML)** : automates iterative tasks of Machine Learning model development, allowing to build Machine Learning models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity, all while sustaining model quality.\n",
    "- **Data Labelling**: an assisted ML tool to automatically label data.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning extension for Visual Studio Code**: provides a full-featured development environment for building and managing Machine Learning projects.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning CLI**: provides commands for managing Azure ML resources from the command line.\n",
    "- **Integration with open-source frameworks** such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and many more for training, deploying and managing the end-to-end Machine Learning process.\n",
    "- **MLflow**: It is an open-source library for managing the life cycle of your Lachine Learning experiments. **MLflow Tracking** is a component of MLflow that logs and tracks your training run metrics and model artifacts, irrespective of your experiment's environment.\n",

This method enables quick testing of the project's viability and to create POC (Proof Of Concept). However, as the project grows and things need to be production ready, it is not feasible to create resources through GUI. We need to programmatically automate everything, from the creation of resources to the deployment of a model. This is where knowing how to use the Azure ML SDK becomes crucial.\n",

The workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning. The workspace keeps a history of all training runs, including logs, metrics, output, and a snapshot of your scripts. You use this information to determine which training run produces the best model.

    "\n",
    "Compute Resources are cloud-based resources on which you can run model training and data exploration processes. There are four kinds of compute resource you can create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compute Instances**: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models. This involves the creation of a Virtual Machine (VM) and launching a notebook instance. You can then train a model by calling a computer cluster from the notebook.\n",
    "- **Compute Clusters**: Scalable clusters of VMs for on-demand processing of experiment code. You will need it when training a model. Compute clusters can also employ specialized GPU or CPU resources.\n",
    "- **Inference Clusters**: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.\n",
    "- **Attached Compute**: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the right options for your compute resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key factors are to consider when creating a compute resource and those choices can be critical decisions to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Do you need CPU or GPU?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized electronic circuit that can execute graphics-related code at a very high rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between CPU and GPU architecture is that a CPU is designed to handle a wide-range of tasks quickly (as measured by CPU clock speed), but are limited in the concurrency of tasks that can be running. GPUs are designed for parallel computing and therefore are much better at deep learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "| CPU                                     | GPU                         |\n",
    "|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n",
    "| Less expensive                          | More expensive              |\n",
    "| Lower level of concurrency              | Higher level of concurrency |\n",
    "| Slower in training deep learning models | Optimal for deep learning   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster size**\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger clusters are more expensive but will result in better responsiveness. Therefore, if you have time but not enough money, you should start with a small cluster. Conversely, if you have money but not much time, you should start with a larger cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VM size**\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your time and budgetary constraints, you can vary the size of your RAM, disk, number of cores and clock speed. Increasing all those parameters will be costlier, but will result in better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dedicated or low-priority instances?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A low-priority instance means that it is interruptible: essentially, Microsoft Azure can take those resources and assign them to another task, thus interrupting a job. A dedicated instance, or non-interruptible, means that the job will never be terminated without your permission.\n",
    "This is another consideration of time vs money, since interruptible instances are less expensive than dedicated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a compute cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Azure ML workspace](https://ml.azure.com/) that we created earlier, go to compute and you will be able to see the different compute resources we just discussed (i.e compute instances, compute clusters, inference clusters and attached compute).
