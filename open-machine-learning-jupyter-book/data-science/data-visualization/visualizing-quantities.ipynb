In general terms, the process of plotting data using these libraries includes identifying the parts of your dataframe that you want to target, performing any transforms on that data necessary, assigning its x and y axis values, deciding what kind of plot to show, and then showing the plot. Matplotlib offers a large variety of visualizations, but for this section, let's focus on the ones most appropriate for visualizing quantity: line charts, scatterplots, and bar plots."
