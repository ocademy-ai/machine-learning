    "# Non-relational data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is not limited to relational databases. This section focuses on non-relational data and will cover the basics of spreadsheets and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spreadsheets\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheets are a popular way to store and explore data because it requires less work to set up and get started. In this section, you'll learn the basic components of a spreadsheet, as well as formulas and functions. The examples will be illustrated with Microsoft Excel, but most of the parts and topics will have similar names and steps in comparison to other spreadsheet software.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An empty Microsoft Excel workbook with two worksheets](https://static-1300131294.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/images/data-science/work-with-data/parts-of-spreadsheet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A spreadsheet is a file and will be accessible in the file system of a computer, device, or cloud-based file system. The software itself may be browser-based or an application that must be installed on a computer or downloaded as an app. In Excel, these files are also defined as **workbooks** and this terminology will be used for the remainder of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A workbook contains one or more **worksheets**, where each worksheet is labeled by tabs. Within a worksheet are rectangles called **cells**, which will contain the actual data. A cell is the intersection of a row and a column, where the columns are labeled with alphabetical characters and rows are labeled numerically. Some spreadsheets will contain headers in the first few rows to describe the data in a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these basic elements of an Excel workbook, we'll use an example from [Microsoft Templates](https://templates.office.com/) focused on an inventory to walk through some additional parts of a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing an inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreadsheet file named \"InventoryExample\" is a formatted spreadsheet of items within an inventory that contains three worksheets, where the tabs are labeled \"Inventory List\", \"Inventory Pick List\" and \"Bin Lookup\". Row 4 of the Inventory List worksheet is the header, which describes the value of each cell in the header column.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A highlighted formula from an example inventory list in Microsoft Excel](https://static-1300131294.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/images/data-science/work-with-data/function-excel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are instances where a cell is dependent on the values of other cells to generate its value. The Inventory List spreadsheet keeps track of the cost of every item in its inventory, but what if we need to know the value of everything in the inventory? [**Formulas**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/overview-of-formulas-34519a4e-1e8d-4f4b-84d4-d642c4f63263) perform actions on cell data and are used to calculate the cost of the inventory in this example. This spreadsheet used a formula in the Inventory Value column to calculate the value of each item by multiplying the quantity under the QTY header and its costs by the cells under the COST header. Double-clicking or highlighting a cell will show the formula. You'll notice that formulas start with an equals sign, followed by the calculation or operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A highlighted function from an example inventory list in Microsoft Excel](https://static-1300131294.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/images/data-science/work-with-data/formula-excel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use another formula to add all the values of Inventory Value together to get its total value. This could be calculated by adding each cell to generate the sum, but that can be a tedious task. Excel has [**functions**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sum-function-043e1c7d-7726-4e80-8f32-07b23e057f89), or predefined formulas to perform calculations on cell values. Functions require arguments, which are the required values used to perform these calculations. When functions require more than one argument, they will need to be listed in a particular order or the function may not calculate the correct value. This example uses the `SUM` function and uses the values of Inventory Value as the argument to add generate the total listed under row 3, column B (also referred to as B3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL is an umbrella term for the different ways to store non-relational data and can be interpreted as \"non-SQL\", \"non-relational\" or  \"not only SQL\". These types of database systems can be categorized into 4 types."
