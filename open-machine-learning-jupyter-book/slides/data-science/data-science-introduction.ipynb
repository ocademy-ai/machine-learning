    "| Ethics Challenge | Case Study  |\n",
    "|--- |--- |\n",
    "| **Informed consent** | 1972 - [Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study) - African American men who participated in the study were promised free medical care _but deceived_ by researchers who failed to inform subjects of their diagnosis or about availability of treatment. Many subjects died & partners or children were affected; the study lasted 40 years. |\n",
    "| **Data privacy** |  2007 - The [Netflix data prize](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/) provided researchers with _10M anonymized movie rankings from 50K customers_ to help improve recommendation algorithms. However, researchers were able to correlate anonymized data with personally-identifiable data in _external datasets_ (e.g., IMDb comments) - effectively \"de-anonymizing\" some Netflix subscribers.|\n",
    "| **Collection bias**  | 2013 - The City of Boston [developed Street Bump](https://www.boston.gov/transportation/street-bump), an app that let citizens report potholes, giving the city better roadway data to find and fix issues. However, [people in lower income groups had less access to cars and phones](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data), making their roadway issues invisible in this app. Developers worked with academics to _equitable access and digital divides_ issues for fairness. |\n",
    "| **Algorithmic fairness**  | 2018 - The MIT [Gender Shades Study](http://gendershades.org/overview.html) evaluated the accuracy of gender classification AI products, exposing gaps in accuracy for women and persons of color. A [2019 Apple Card](https://www.wired.com/story/the-apple-card-didnt-see-genderand-thats-the-problem/) seemed to offer less credit to women than men. Both illustrated issues in algorithmic bias leading to socio-economic harms.|\n",
    "| **Data misrepresentation** | 2020 - The [Georgia Department of Public Health released COVID-19 charts](https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-us-response-trump/2020/5/18/21262265/georgia-covid-19-cases-declining-reopening) that appeared to mislead citizens about trends in confirmed cases with non-chronological ordering on the x-axis. This illustrates misrepresentation through visualization tricks. |\n",
    "| **Illusion of free choice** | 2020 - Learning app [ABCmouse paid $10M to settle an FTC complaint](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/04/abcmouse-10-million-ftc-settlement/) where parents were trapped into paying for subscriptions they couldn't cancel. This illustrates dark patterns in choice architectures, where users were nudged towards potentially harmful choices. |\n",
    "| **Data privacy & user rights** | 2021 - Facebook [Data Breach](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/986005820/after-data-breach-exposes-530-million-facebook-says-it-will-not-notify-users) exposed data from 530M users, resulting in a $5B settlement to the FTC. It however refused to notify users of the breach violating user rights around data transparency and access. |"
