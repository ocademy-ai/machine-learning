    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the main objective of any machine learning model is to generalize the learning based on training data, so that it will be able to do predictions accurately on unknown data. Here are a few concepts: the first is 'Hypothesis', the second is 'Truth'. When we obtain data and train it, we propose a hypothesis, and the process of forcing the hypothesis to be as close to the truth as possible is our training process. This process is called 'fitting', which means the model tries to learn the patterns, relationships, or rules in the data in order to make predictions or classifications on unknown data. Due to the existence of errors in the hypothesis, we introduce the concepts of generalization error and empirical error (training error). The generalization error represents the error in unknown samples when we fit the model to the truth. It is uncertain. On the other hand, the empirical error represents the error on the training set, and it can be determined. In order to reduce the error and approach the truth, we need model evaluation. However, due to the occurrence of overfitting, a smaller error does not necessarily indicate a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can notice the words 'Overfitting' and 'Underfitting' are kind of opposite of the term 'Generalization'. Overfitting and underfitting models don't generalize well and results in poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the samples of over-fitting and under-fitting in regression:\n",

    "### Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underfitting occurs when machine learning model don't fit the training data well enough. It is usually caused by simple function that cannot capture the underlying trend in the data.\n",
    "* Underfitting models have high error in training as well as test set. This behavior is called as 'Low Bias'\n",
    "* This usually happens when we try to fit linear function for non-linear data.\n",
    "* Since underfitting models don't perform well on training set, it's very easy to detect underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How To Avoid Underfitting?\n",
    "* Increasing the model complexity. e.g. If linear function under fit then try using polynomial features\n",
    "* Increase the number of features by performing the feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    "* Overfitting occurs when machine learning model tries to fit the training data too well. It is usually caused by complicated function that creates lots of unnecessary curves and angles that are not related with data and end up capturing the noise in data.\n",
    "* Overfitting models have low error in training set but high error in test set. This behavior is called as 'High Variance'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How To Avoid Overfitting?\n",
    "* Since overfitting algorithm captures the noise in data, reducing the number of features will help. We can manually select only important features or can use model selection algorithm for same\n",
    "* We can also use the 'Regularization' technique. It works well when we have lots of slightly useful features. Sklearn linear model(Ridge and LASSO) uses regularization parameter 'alpha' to control the size of the coefficients by imposing a penalty. Please refer below tutorials for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Fitting \n",
    "* It is a sweet spot between Underfitting and Overfitting model\n",
    "* A good fitting model generalizes the learnings from training data and provide accurate predictions on new data\n",
    "* To get the good fitting model, keep training and testing the model till you get the minimum train and test error. Here important parameter is 'test error' because low train error may cause overfitting so always keep an eye on test error fluctuations. The sweet spot is just before the test error start to rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary the goal of model selection is to find a model that fits the training data well and has low prediction error on new unknown data. If a model that is too simple is chosen, it may not fit the training data well, resulting in underfitting. On the other hand, if a model that is too complex is chosen, overfitting may occur, leading to a decrease in predictive performance on new data.\n",
    "Now let's take a look at another example, hoping it will be helpful for your understanding.\n",

    "## Bias variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we talk about Bias Variance tradeoff \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is Bias and Variance? Or to say why they are so importent in model selection? \n",
    "\n",
    "Bias refers to the model's incorrect assumptions or simplifications about the problem. When a model has high bias, it may overlook some key features or patterns in the data, resulting in systematic errors in the predictions. In other words, a high-bias model tends to produce incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance refers to the sensitivity or volatility of the model to the training data. When a model has high variance, it is very sensitive to small perturbations in the training data and may overfit the noise and details in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data. In other words, a high-variance model is more prone to the influence of randomness and produces larger prediction errors.\n",

    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Were there some ways that can be used to represent the bias and variance of a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, when we start training, how to evaluate the goodness of fit?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way is to output some metrics that can substitute for bias and variance. Here are several metrics that can be used for calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy**：Accuracy is a commonly used evaluation metric in classification models. It represents the proportion of correctly classified samples in the predictions made by the model. A higher accuracy indicates better performance. However, when there is class imbalance in the dataset, accuracy may underestimate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision and Recall**：Precision and recall are primarily used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models, especially in the presence of class imbalance. Precision represents the proportion of true positive samples among those predicted as positive, while recall represents the proportion of true positive samples among all actual positive samples. Precision and recall can help provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 Score**：The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of a model's accuracy and recall performance. A higher F1 score indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**：MSE is a commonly used evaluation metric in regression models. It represents the average of the squared differences between predicted values and true values. A smaller MSE indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log Loss**: Log loss is commonly used in binary or multi-class probability prediction problems. It measures the difference between predicted probabilities and true labels. A lower log loss indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of models in the model selection process. However, it's important to note that these metrics only reflect the fit of the model to a particular dataset and may not fully capture its generalization performance.\n",

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which considers both the accuracy and the identification ability of the model.Bias refers to the extent to which a model makes incorrect assumptions or oversimplifies the problem, and it is related to the model's prediction accuracy. A lower bias indicates that the model can better fit the training data and is closer to the true underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score aims to consider both the precision and recall of the model. For certain applications, we are concerned with both the model's prediction accuracy (precision) and its ability to identify positive instances (recall). Therefore, a higher F1 score indicates that the model performs well in balancing prediction accuracy and identification ability.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping, also known as resampling or sampling with replacement, is a technique where each time a copy of a sample is selected from a dataset containing m samples and added to the resulting dataset. This process is repeated m times, resulting in a dataset with m samples. (Some samples may appear multiple times in the resulting dataset.) This resulting dataset is then used as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sampling is conducted independently, the probability that a specific sample is never selected in m iterations of sampling is $ [(1-\\frac{1}{m})^m] $. As m approaches infinity, $ lim_{m \\to \\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{m})^m = \\frac{1}{e} $ the limit of this probability is $1/e$ , where e is the base of the natural logarithm and approximately equal to 2.71828. Therefore, when m is sufficiently large, the probability that a specific sample is never selected in m iterations of sampling is close to $\\frac{1}{e} ≈ 0.36787944117$ .\n"

    "## Interpreting the Learning Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think about the information in the training data as being of two kinds: *signal* and *noise*. The signal is the part that generalizes, the part that can help our model make predictions from new data. The noise is that part that is *only* true of the training data; the noise is all of the random fluctuation that comes from data in the real-world or all of the incidental, non-informative patterns that can't actually help the model make predictions. The noise is the part might look useful but really isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "We train a model by choosing weights or parameters that minimize the loss on a training set. You might know, however, that to accurately assess a model's performance, we need to evaluate it on a new set of data, the *validation* data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a model we've been plotting the loss on the training set epoch by epoch. To this we'll add a plot the validation data too. These plots we call the **learning curves**. To train deep learning models effectively, we need to be able to interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the training loss will go down either when the model learns signal or when it learns noise. But the validation loss will go down only when the model learns signal. (Whatever noise the model learned from the training set won't generalize to new data.) So, when a model learns signal both curves go down, but when it learns noise a *gap* is created in the curves. The size of the gap tells you how much noise the model has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would create models that learn all of the signal and none of the noise. This will practically never happen. Instead we make a trade. We can get the model to learn more signal at the cost of learning more noise. So long as the trade is in our favor, the validation loss will continue to decrease. After a certain point, however, the trade can turn against us, the cost exceeds the benefit, and the validation loss begins to rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trade-off indicates that there can be two problems that occur when training a model: not enough signal or too much noise. Underfitting the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model hasn't learned enough *signal*. Overfitting the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model learned too much *noise*. The trick to training deep learning models is finding the best balance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at a couple ways of getting more signal out of the training data while reducing the amount of noise later.\n"

    "## Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "A model's **capacity** refers to the size and complexity of the patterns it is able to learn. For neural networks, this will largely be determined by how many neurons it has and how they are connected together. If it appears that your network is underfitting the data, you should try increasing its capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can increase the capacity of a network either by making it *wider* (more units to existing layers) or by making it *deeper* (adding more layers). Wider networks have an easier time learning more linear relationships, while deeper networks prefer more nonlinear ones. Which is better just depends on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll explore how the capacity of a network can affect its performance in the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining an appropriate model capacity is a crucial task in model selection. Here are some common methods and guidelines to help determine the right model capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb**: In general, if the dataset is small or the task is relatively simple, choosing a lower-capacity model may be more suitable to avoid overfitting. For larger datasets or complex tasks, a higher-capacity model may be able to better fit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-validation**: This method has been mentioned earlier in the previous text, and it is an extremely important approach in model selection. Therefore, it is necessary to mention this method multiple times and gain a deeper understanding of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning curves**: Learning curves can help determine if the model capacity is appropriate. By plotting the performance of the model on the training set and the validation set as the number of training samples increases, one can observe the model's fitting and generalization abilities. If the model performs poorly on both the training set and the validation set, it may be underfitting due to low capacity. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, it may be overfitting due to high capacity. Adjustments to the model capacity can be made based on the trend of the learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization**: Adjusting the model capacity through regularization techniques (which we will also mention in the text later). Increasing the regularization parameter can reduce model capacity and decrease the risk of overfitting. Decreasing the regularization parameter can increase model capacity and improve fitting ability. By evaluating the model performance on the validation set with different regularization parameters, an appropriate regularization parameter value can be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model comparison experiments**: Train and evaluate models with different capacities and compare their performance on the validation set. By comparing the generalization performance of different-capacity models, select the model capacity with the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the above methods and guidelines, selecting an appropriate model capacity requires a balance between theory and practice and decision-making based on the specific problem and available resources. The ultimate goal is to choose a model that performs well on both the training data and new data, achieving good generalization ability."

    "## L1 and L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with Occam's Razor principle: given two explanations for something, the explanation most likely to be correct is the 'simplest' one, the one that makes the least amount of assumptions. This also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple models) that could explain the data, and simple models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'simple model' in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy (or a model with fewer parmeters altogether, as we saw in the section above). Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weeights only to  take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more 'regular'. This is called 'weight regularization', and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with having large weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a target function with a regularization term, which can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = L(\\theta) + \\lambda R(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $J(\\theta)$ is the target function, $\\theta$ represents the model's parameters, $L(\\theta)$ is the loss function (typically the model's error on the training data), $R(\\theta)$ is the regularization term, and \\lambda is the regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function $L(\\theta)$ measures how well the model fits the training data, and our goal is to minimize it. The regularization term $R(\\theta)$ constrains or penalizes the values of the model's parameters, and it controls the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization parameter $\\lambda$ determines the weight of the regularization term in the target function. When $\\lambda$ approaches $\\theta$, the impact of the regularization term becomes negligible, and the model's objective is primarily to minimize the loss function. On the other hand, when $\\lambda$ approaches infinity, the regularization term's impact becomes significant, and the model's objective is to minimize the regularization term as much as possible, leading to parameter values tending towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two forms of this cost: L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regression) with the regularization term $R(\\theta)$ represented as the sum of the absolute values of the parameters $\\theta$: $R(\\theta) = ||\\theta||_1$. L1 regularization can induce certain parameters of the model to become zero, thereby achieving feature selection and sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regression) with the regularization term $R(\\theta)$ represented as the square root of the sum of the squares of the parameters $\\theta$: $R(\\theta) = ||\\theta||_2$. L2 regularization encourages the parameter values of the model to gradually approach zero but not exactly become zero, hence it does not possess the ability for feature selection.\n",

    "We mentioned that when a model is too eagerly learning noise, the validation loss may start to increase during training. To prevent this, we can simply stop the training whenever it seems the validation loss isn't decreasing anymore. Interrupting the training this way is called **early stopping**.\n",

So besides preventing overfitting from training too long, early stopping can also prevent *underfitting* from not training long enough.

    "When $\\lambda$ is large, the effect of weight regularization becomes more pronounced. The network is constrained to simpler patterns and structures, reducing the risk of overfitting.

    "Choosing the appropriate value of $\\lambda$ requires adjustment and optimization based on the specific problem and dataset. Typically, cross-validation or other evaluation methods can be used to select the optimal $\\lambda$ value, finding a balance between model complexity and generalization ability.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, if the training data contains noise or outliers, or if the training set is relatively small, the model may overfit the data, leading to a decrease in prediction performance on new data. In such cases, regularization can help control the complexity of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding L2 regularization (Ridge regularization) to the linear regression model, we introduce the square of the L2 norm of the parameters as a penalty term in the loss function. This encourages the model to prefer smaller parameter values during training, preventing the parameters from becoming too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of regularization is achieved by balancing the trade-off between minimizing the training error and minimizing the penalty term. A larger regularization parameter will penalize larger parameter values more strongly, making the model smoother and reducing the differences between parameters. This helps reduce the risk of overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability on new data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural network, developed by Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto. Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. set to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample during training; aafter applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The 'dropout rate' is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n",
