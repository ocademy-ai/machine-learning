    "The picture above shows that, more often than not, customers pay great attention to staff and the price-quality ratio. This couple of factors affects the resulting overall rating the most. The difference between these two features and other features is not very large, so we can conclude that exclusion of any of these features will lead to a reduction of model's accuracy. However, based on our analysis, we can recommend hostel owners to focus primarily on staff training and price-to-quality ratio."
