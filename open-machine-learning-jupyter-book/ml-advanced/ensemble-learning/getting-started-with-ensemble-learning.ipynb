    "[Condorcet's jury theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem) (1784) is about an ensemble in some sense. It states that, if each member of the jury makes an independent judgment and the probability of the correct decision by each juror is more than 0.5, then the probability of the correct decision by the whole jury increases with the total number of jurors and tends to one. On the other hand, if the probability of being right is less than 0.5 for each juror, then the probability of the correct decision by the whole jury decreases with the number of jurors and tends to zero. \n",
