It states that, if each member of the jury makes an independent judgment and the probability of the correct decision by each juror is more than 0.5, then the probability of the correct decision by the whole jury increases with the total number of jurors and tends to one. On the other hand, if the probability of being right is less than 0.5 for each juror, then the probability of the correct decision by the whole jury decreases with the number of jurors and tends to zero. \n",

    "## Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bagging* (also known as [Bootstrap aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating)) is one of the first and most basic ensemble techniques. It was proposed by [Leo Breiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman) in 1994. Bagging is based on the statistical method of [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29), which makes the evaluation of many statistics of complex models feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap method goes as follows. Let there be a sample $\\large X$ of size $\\large N$. We can make a new sample from the original sample by drawing $\\large N$ elements from the latter randomly and uniformly, with replacement. In other words, we select a random element from the original sample of size $\\large N$ and do this $\\large N$ times. All elements are equally likely to be selected, thus each element is drawn with the equal probability $\\large \\frac{1}{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are drawing balls from a bag one at a time. At each step, the selected ball is put back into the bag so that the next selection is made equiprobably i.e. from the same number of balls $\\large N$. Note that, because we put the balls back, there may be duplicates in the new sample. Let's call this new sample $\\large X_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating this procedure $\\large M$ times, we create $\\large M$ *bootstrap samples* $\\large X_1, \\dots, X_M$. In the end, we have a sufficient number of samples and can compute various statistics of the original distribution."
