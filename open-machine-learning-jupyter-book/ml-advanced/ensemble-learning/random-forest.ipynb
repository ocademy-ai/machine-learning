    "[Leo Breiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman) managed to apply bootstrapping not only in statistics but also in machine learning. He, along with Adel Cutler, extended and improved the random forest algorithm [proposed by Tin Kam Ho](http://ect.bell-labs.com/who/tkh/publications/papers/odt.pdf). They combined the construction of uncorrelated trees using [CART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Classification_and_regression_trees_.28CART.29), bagging, and the [random subspace method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_subspace_method).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a good choice for the base classifier in bagging because they are quite sophisticated and can achieve zero classification error on any sample. The random subspace method reduces the correlation between the trees and thus prevents overfitting. With bagging, the base algorithms are trained on different random subsets of the original feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following algorithm constructs an ensemble of models using the random subspace method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let the number of instances be equal to $\\large \\ell$, and the number of features be equal to $\\large d$.\n",
    "2. Choose $\\large L$ as the number of individual models in the ensemble. \n",
    "3. For each model $\\large l$, choose the number of features $\\large dl < d$. As a rule, the same value of $\\large dl$ is used for all the models.\n",
    "4. For each model $\\large l$, create a training set by selecting $\\large dl$ features at random from the whole set of $\\large d$ features.\n",
    "5. Train each model.\n",
    "6. Apply the resulting ensemble model to a new instance by combining the results from all the models in $\\large L$. You can use either majority voting or aggregation of the posterior probabilities."

    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The [scikit-learn library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) implements random forests by providing two estimators: `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomForestRegressor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of random forest parameters for regression is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `n_estimators` — the number of trees in the forest (default = 10)\n",
    "   - `criterion` — the function used to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are \"mse\" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance reduction as feature selection criterion, and \"mae\" for the mean absolute error (default = \"mse\")\n",
    "   - `max_features` — the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. You can specify the number or percentage of features, or choose from the available values: \"auto\" (all features), \"sqrt\", \"log2\". (default = \"auto\")\n",
    "   -  `max_depth` — the maximum depth of the tree (default means that nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples)\n",
    "   -  `min_samples_split` — the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Can be specified as the number or as a percentage of a total number of samples (default = 2)\n",
    "   -  `min_samples_leaf` — the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node(default = 1)\n",
    "   -  `min_weight_fraction_leaf` — the minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided (default = 0)\n",
    "   - `max_leaf_nodes` — the maximum number of leaves (default = no restrictions)\n",
    "   - `min_impurity_split` — threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf (default = 1е-7)\n",
    "   - `bootstrap` — whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees(default = True)\n",
    "   - `oob_score` — whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the R^2 on unseen data (default = False)\n",
    "   - `n_jobs` — the number of jobs to run in parallel for both fit and predict. If -1, then the number of jobs is set to the number of cores (default = 1)\n",
    "   - `random_state` — if int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; if RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator; if None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random (default = None)\n",
    "   - `verbose` — controls the verbosity of the tree building process (default = 0)\n",
    "   - `warm_start` — when set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole new forest (default = False)\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of classification, parameters are mostly the same. Only the following differ for `RandomForestClassifier` as compared to `RandomForestRegressor`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `criterion` — the function used to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are \"gini\" for the Gini impurity and \"entropy\" for the information gain. Note: this parameter is tree-specific (default = \"gini\")\n",
    "   - `class_weight` — the weight of each class (by default all weights equal to 1, but you can create a dictionary with weights or specify it as \"balanced\" - uses the values of classes to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data or as \"balanced_subsample\" - the same as \"balanced\" except that weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree grown)\n",
    "   \n",
    "Below are the parameters which we need to pay attention to when we are building a new model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_estimators` — the number of trees in the forest;\n",
    "- `criterion` — the function used to measure the quality of a split;\n",
    "- `max_features` — the number of features to consider when looking for the best split;\n",
    "- `min_samples_leaf` — the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node;\n",
    "- `max_depth` — the maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice with random forests in a real problem\n",

    "## Transformation of a dataset into a high-dimensional representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are mostly used in supervised learning, but there is a way to apply them in the unsupervised setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `scikit-learn` method [RandomTreesEmbedding](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding), we can transform our dataset into a high-dimensional, [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) representation. We first build extremely randomized trees and then use the index of the leaf containing the example as a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the input appears in the first leaf, we assign $1$ as the feature value; if not, we assign $0$. This is a so-called *binary coding*. We can control the number of features and the sparseness of data by increasing or decreasing the number of trees and their depth. Because nearby data points are likely to fall into the same leaf, this transformation provides an implicit nonparametric estimate of their density.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and cons of random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High prediction accuracy; will perform better than linear algorithms in most problems; the accuracy is comparable with that of boosting.\n",
    "- Robust to outliers, thanks to random sampling.\n",
    "- Insensitive to the scaling of features as well as any other monotonic transformations due to the random subspace selection.\n",
    "- Doesn't require fine-grained parameter tuning, works quite well out-of-the-box. With tuning, it is possible to achieve a 0.5-3% gain in accuracy, depending on the problem setting and data.\n",
    "- Efficient for datasets with a large number of features and classes.\n",
    "- Handles both continuous and discrete variables equally well.\n",
    "- Rarely overfits. In practice, an increase in the tree number almost always improves the composition. But, after reaching a certain number of trees, the learning curve is very close to the asymptote.\n",
    "- There are developed methods to estimate feature importance.\n",
    "- Works well with missing data and maintains good accuracy even when a large part of data is missing.\n",
    "- Provides means to weight classes on the whole dataset as well as for each tree sample.\n",
    "- Under the hood, calculates proximities between pairs of examples that can subsequently be used in clustering, outlier detection, or interesting data representations.\n",
    "- The above functionality and properties may be extended to unlabeled data to enable unsupervised clustering, data visualization, and outlier detection.\n",
    "- Easily parallelized and highly scalable.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In comparison with a single decision tree, Random Forest's output is more difficult to interpret.\n",
    " - There are no formal p-values for feature significance estimation.\n",
    " - Performs worse than linear methods in the case of sparse data: text inputs, bag of words, etc.\n",
    " - Unlike linear regression, Random Forest is unable to extrapolate. But, this can be also regarded as an advantage because outliers do not cause extreme values in Random Forests.\n",
    " - Prone to overfitting in some problems, especially, when dealing with noisy data.\n",
    " - In the case of categorical variables with varying level numbers, random forests favor variables with a greater number of levels. The tree will fit more towards a feature with many levels because this gains greater accuracy.\n",
    " - If a dataset contains groups of correlated features, preference might be given to groups of smaller size. See [this work](http://rnowling.github.io/machine/learning/2015/08/11/random-forest-correlation-bias.html).\n",
    " - The resulting model is large and requires a lot of RAM.\n",
