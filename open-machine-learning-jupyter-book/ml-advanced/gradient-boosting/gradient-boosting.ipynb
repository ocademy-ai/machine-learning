With this work, Friedman set up the statistical foundation for many algorithms providing the general approach of boosting for optimization in the functional space.\n",

    "\n",
    "It took more than 10 years after the introduction of GBM for it to become an essential part of the data science toolbox.   \n",
    "GBM was extended to apply to different statistics problems: GLMboost and GAMboost for strengthening already existing GAM models, CoxBoost for survival curves, and RankBoost and LambdaMART for ranking.   \n",
    "Many realizations of GBM also appeared under different names and on different platforms: Stochastic GBM, GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees), GBRT (Gradient Boosted Regression Trees), MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees), and more. In addition, the ML community was very segmented and dissociated, which made it hard to track just how widespread boosting had become.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, boosting had been actively used in search ranking. This problem was rewritten in terms of a loss function that penalizes errors in the output order, so it became convenient to simply insert it into GBM. AltaVista was one of the first companies who introduced boosting to ranking. Soon, the ideas spread to Yahoo, Yandex, Bing, etc. Once this happened, boosting became one of the main algorithms that was used not only in research but also in core technologies in industry.\n",

Now, researchers had a common platform where they could compete in different data science problems with large number of participants from around the world. With Kaggle, one could test new algorithms on the real data, giving algoritms oppurtunity to \"shine\", and provide full information in sharing model performance results across competition data sets. This is exactly what happened to boosting when it was used at [Kaggle](http://blog.kaggle.com/2011/12/21/score-xavier-conort-on-coming-second-in-give-me-some-credit/) (check interviews with Kaggle winners starting from 2011 who mostly used boosting). The [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) library quickly gained popularity after its appearance. XGBoost is not a new, unique algorithm; it is just an extremely effective realization of classic GBM with additional heuristics.\n",

    "We achieved the result that we expected. First, we can see how strongly the pseudo-residuals differ; on the initial iteration, they look almost like the original cosine. Second, the left part of the function's graph was often ignored in favor of the right one, which had larger weights. Third, the function that we got on the third iteration received enough attention and started looking similar to the original cosine (also started to slightly overfit).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we learned the theory behind gradient boosting. GBM is not just some specific algorithm but a common methodology for building ensembles of models. In addition, this methodology is sufficiently flexible and expandable -- it is possible to train a large number of models, taking into consideration different loss-functions with a variety of weighting functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice and ML competitions show that, in standard problems (except for image, audio, and very sparse data), GBM is often the most effective algorithm (not to mention stacking and high-level ensembles, where GBM is almost always a part of them).  Also, there are many adaptations of GBM [for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04119) (Minecraft, ICML 2016). By the way, the Viola-Jones algorithm, which is still used in computer vision, [is based on AdaBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework#Learning_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we intentionally omitted questions concerning GBM’s regularization, stochasticity, and hyper-parameters. It was not accidental that we used a small number of iterations $\\large M = 3$ throughout. If we used 30 trees instead of 3 and trained the GBM as described, the result would not be that predictable:         "
