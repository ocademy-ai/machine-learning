<p style="font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:120%;color:#444160;">In this
project, I will be building a model to generate text. My goal is to build a song
lyrics generator to explore the "creative" side of the Recurrent Neural
Networks(RNN). RNN Text generator is one of my most desired to-do projects. I am
finally checking this one off my to-do list. So yeyyy! </p>

radius:20px 60px;">LOADING DATA</p>
For this project, I have prepared a dataset of song lyrics. Let's load it and
have a look.

```python
data = pd.read_csv("../input/lyrics/Songs.csv")
data.head()
```

<a id="3"></a>
# <p style="background-color:#B291B6;font-
family:newtimeroman;color:#444160;font-size:150%;text-align:center;border-
radius:20px 60px;">DATA EXPLORATION</p>

**In this section, I will be:**
* Exploring the various artists in data
* Explore the number of songs and their corresponding information
* Explore the various words in lyrics via wordcloud

```python
#Printing the names of artists in the lyrics data
print("Artists in the data:\n",data.Artist.value_counts()) 
```

```python
#Printing the size of dataset
print("Size of Dataset:",data.shape)
```

So I have a total of 745 songs

**I will do a little feature engineering to extract more information on the
songs such as:**
* Number of characters
* Number of words
* Number of lines

```python
#Adding a column of numbers of Characters,words and sentences in each msg
data["No_of_Characters"] = data["Lyrics"].apply(len)
data["No_of_Words"]=data.apply(lambda row: nltk.word_tokenize(row["Lyrics"]), axis=1).apply(len)
data["No_of_Lines"] = data["Lyrics"].str.split('\n').apply(len)
data.describe()
```

To be noted: On average our songs have 1400-ish characters

```python
#Plotting the comparative song lengths for various artists
plt.figure(figsize=(15,15))
ax = sns.pairplot(data, hue="Artist", palette="plasma")
```

```python
# Generate a word cloud image
stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
wordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords, background_color="#444160",colormap="Purples", max_words=800).generate(" ".join(data["Lyrics"]))
plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation="bilinear")
plt.show()
```

*Unsurprisingly one of the most frequent words in songs is "Love".*

Next let us look at the lyrics of song No 42 in the lyrics. Why 42 you may ask!
Well! because it is the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
and Everything. üê¨

```python
#A function to disply the song in an asthetically pleasing way! lol
def My_song(song):
    img = Image.open("../input/image-for-notebook/Pink and White Geometric Marketing Presentation (1).png")
    Text_on_image = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    myFont = ImageFont.truetype("../input/font-style/DancingScript-VariableFont_wght.ttf", 45)
    Text_on_image.text((620,90), song, font=myFont, fill =(255, 255, 255))
    return img    
#Having a look at the first 500 charachters of a random song lyrics
My_song(data.Lyrics[42][:500])
```

The generation of text with RNN involves the following workflow.

As I have loaded and explored the data,  I will proceed further by pre-
processing the text.

radius:20px 60px;">DATA PREPROCESSING</p>

**In this section, I will be performing the following:**

**Creating a Corpus of Lyrics text:** For the model, we need a sequence of the
text string. I am creating a Corpus out of Lyrics column.

**Removing the unrequired characters that may have sneaked in my text corpus:**
The data cleaning process for NLP is crucial preprocessing. To do that, I look
into the Corpus to check for what this Corpus is comprised of. That is, all the
unique symbols present. After examining the Corpus, I will be eliminating any
foreign language or irrelevant symbols from the Corpus.

**Creating a dictionary to map characters and their indices:** The computer
doesn‚Äôt understand the text. For the computer, the text is just a cluster of
symbols. It works with numbers. So we create a dictionary to map each unique
character in our Corpus to a number and vice versa. This will be used to encode
and decode the information going in and getting out of the RNN

**Splitting the corpus into smaller sentences of equal length:** Encoding and
splitting the corpus into smaller sequences of equal length: At this point,
Corpus contain only intended characters (i.e, lower cap English alphabets,
Numbers and a few punctuations). We will encode this corpus and create small
sequences of equal lengths of features and the corresponding targets. Each
feature and target will contain the mapped index in the dictionary of the unique
characters they signify.

The labels are then resized and normalized. Whereas the targets are one-hot
encoded. Ready to be sent to the RNN for the training, but before that let us
built the RNN model.

**Creating a Corpus**

```python
#Lining up all the lyrics to create corpus
Corpus =''
for listitem in data.Lyrics:
    Corpus += listitem
    
Corpus = Corpus.lower() #converting all alphabets to lowecase 
print("Number of unique characters:", len(set(Corpus)))
```

The total number of unique characters present in the Corpus clearly shows, that
some of the foreign language scripts have sneaked in. I will take a look at all
the characters present. I will then remove the unrequired characters.

```python
#To See all the unique characters present in the Corpus
print("The unique characters:",sorted(set(Corpus)))
```

```python
#Keeping only a limited set of characters. 
to_remove = ['{', '}', '~', '¬©', '√†', '√°', '√£', '√§', '√ß', '√®', '√©', '√™', '√´', '√≠', '√±', '√≥', '√∂', '√º', '≈è',
             '–µ', 'ÿß', 'ÿ≥', 'ŸÑ', 'ŸÖ', 'Ÿà', '\u2005', '\u200a', '\u200b', '‚Äì', '‚Äî', '‚Äò', '‚Äô', '‚Äö', '‚Äú', '‚Äù', 
             '‚Ä¶', '\u205f', '\ufeff', '!', '&', '(', ')', '*', '-',  '/', ]
for symbol in to_remove:
    Corpus = Corpus.replace(symbol," ")

#Corpus = re.sub("[^A-Za-z0-9'\.\n]","",Corpus) Alterneativly could be used but I want to pick and chose (:
```

```python
#To See all the unique characters present in the Corpus
print("The unique characters:",sorted(set(Corpus)))
```

**Creating a list of sorted unique characters**

```python
# Storing all the unique characters present in my corpus to bult a mapping dic. 
symb = sorted(list(set(Corpus)))

L_corpus = len(Corpus) #length of corpus
L_symb = len(symb) #length of total unique characters

#Building dictionary to access the vocabulary from indices and vice versa
mapping = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(symb))
reverse_mapping = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(symb))

print("Total number of characters:", L_corpus)
print("Number of unique characters:", L_symb)
```

```python
#Splitting the Corpus in equal length of strings and output target
length = 40
features = []
targets = []
for i in range(0, L_corpus - length, 1):
    feature = Corpus[i:i + length]
    target = Corpus[i + length]
    features.append([mapping[j] for j in feature])
    targets.append(mapping[target])
    
    
L_datapoints = len(targets)
print("Total number of sequences in the Corpus:", L_datapoints)
```

**Encoding the Labels and Targets**

```python
# reshape X and normalize
X = (np.reshape(features, (L_datapoints, length, 1)))/ float(L_symb)

# one hot encode the output variable
y = np_utils.to_categorical(targets)
```

BUILDING</p>


Recurrent Neural Networks are pretty popular with generating text. In this
project, I will be using a LSTM Model, an improved version of a standard
recurrent neural network

**Following steps are involved in the model building**

* Initialising the Model
* Defining by adding layers
* Compiling the Model
* Training the Model

**Building the Model**

```python
#Initialising the Model
model = Sequential()
#Adding layers
model.add(LSTM(256, input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(y.shape[1], activation='softmax'))
#Compiling the model for training  
opt = Adamax(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=opt)

#Model's Summary               
model.summary()


```

```python
#Training the Model
history = model.fit(X, y, batch_size=128, epochs=100)
```

```python
from keras.models import load_model
#To be used later; I am saving the model 
model.save("Lyrics_Generator.h5")
```

MODELS</p>

Now that I have my model trained on the songs lyrics let us see how it performs.
I hope it creates some sensible song.

**To evaluate my model, I shall be having a look at:**
* The performance of the model via Learning Curves
* The outcome text it generates

**Plotting the learning curve for the loss function**

```python
history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
#Plotting the learnings 

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,4), facecolor="#B291B6")
fig.suptitle("Learning Plot of Model for Loss")
pl=sns.lineplot(data=history_df["loss"],color="#444160")
pl.set(ylabel ="Training Loss")
pl.set(xlabel ="Epochs")
```

**Generating the songs**

```python
# The function to generate text from model
def Lyrics_Generator(starter,Ch_count): #,temperature=1.0):
    generated= ""
    starter = starter 
    seed=[mapping[char] for char in starter]
    generated += starter 
    # Generating new text of given length
    for i in range(Ch_count):
        seed=[mapping[char] for char in starter]
        x_pred = np.reshape(seed, (1, len(seed), 1))
        x_pred = x_pred/ float(L_symb)
        prediction = model.predict(x_pred, verbose=0)[0]  
        # Getting the index of the next most probable index
        prediction = np.asarray(prediction).astype('float64')
        prediction = np.log(prediction) / 1.0 
        exp_preds = np.exp(prediction)
        prediction = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
        probas = np.random.multinomial(1, prediction, 1)
        index = np.argmax(prediction)
        next_char = reverse_mapping[index]  
        # Generating new text
        generated += next_char
        starter = starter[1:] + next_char
       
    return generated
```

Let us finally see the outcome by putting a seed in from one of my old blogposts
[blogpost](https://karnikakapoor.blogspot.com/2017/04/killers-confession.html)

```python
#Generating a song from the model
song_1 = Lyrics_Generator("the shoe shrunk, and the school belt got ridiculously petit", 400)
#Let's have a look at the song
My_song(song_1)
```

Another song generated by a seed of the lyrics of a song that's stuck in my head
today. (Sunflower by Shannon Purser)

```python
#Generating a song from the model using a song out of the corpus
song_2 = Lyrics_Generator("i'm a sunflower, a little funny", 400)
#Let's have a look at the song
My_song(song_2)
```

# <p style="background-color:#B291B6;font-family:newtimeroman;font-
size:150%;color:#444160;text-align:center;border-radius:20px
60px;">CONCLUSION</p>
<p style="font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:120%;color:#444160">On observing
the output of the Lyrics Generator, it is clear that while some of the sentences
might be correct, but most of the lyrics do not make sense. It does look like a
song tho. The model didn't learn the meaning of the songs. However, the
character-based approach is producing some legitimate words.
To get to a song that makes better sense I may consider a transformer-based text
generator, but that's for some other time.</p>

<p style="font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:120%;color:#444160;"> Neural
networks amaze me all the time. There is something surreal about them that makes
working with it exciting. Of course, we can peel off the layers and see the
maths behind them. Get to the matrices and tensor to understand how these
neurons are working. Even get the values of weights and biases and assure
ourselves that this is no sorcery.  Still, when I see the result play out it is
astonishing.</p>
