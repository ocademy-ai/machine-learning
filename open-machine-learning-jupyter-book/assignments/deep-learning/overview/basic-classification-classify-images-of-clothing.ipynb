    "-  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that's based on artificial neural networks. The learning process is deep because the structure of artificial neural networks consists of multiple input, output, and hidden layers. Each layer contains units that transform the input data into information that the next layer can use for a certain predictive task. Thanks to this structure, a machine can learn through its own data processing.\n",
    "-  Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses techniques (such as deep learning) that enable machines to use experience to improve at tasks. The learning process is based on the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feed data into an algorithm. (In this step you can provide additional information to the model, for example, by performing feature extraction.)\n",
    "Use this data to train a model.\n",
    "2. Test and deploy the model.\n",
    "3. Consume the deployed model to do an automated predictive task. (In other words, call and use the deployed model to receive the predictions returned by the model.)\n",

    "Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses techniques (such as deep learning) to generate new content. For example, you can use generative AI to create images, text, or audio. These models leverage massive pre-trained knowledge to generate this content.\n",
