Autoencoders are trained in an unsupervised manner in order to learn the exteremely low level repersentations of the input data. These low level features are then deformed back to project the actual data. An autoencoder is a regression task where the network is asked to predict its input (in other words, model the identity function). These networks has a tight bottleneck of a few neurons in the middle, forcing them to create effective representations that compress the input into a low-dimensional code that can be used by the decoder to reproduce the original input.\n","\n","A typical autoencoder architecture comprises of three main components: \n","\n","- **Encoding Architecture :** The encoder architecture comprises of series of layers with decreasing number of nodes and ultimately reduces to a latent view repersentation.  \n","- **Latent View Repersentation :** Latent view repersents the lowest level space in which the inputs are reduced and information is preserved.  \n","- **Decoding Architecture :** The decoding architecture is the mirro image of the encoding architecture but in which number of nodes in every layer increases and ultimately outputs the similar (almost) input.  \n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/Rrmaise.png)\n","\n","A highly fine tuned autoencoder model should be able to reconstruct the same input which was passed in the first layer. In this kernel, I will walk you through the working of autoencoders and their implementation.  Autoencoders are widly used with the image data and some of their use cases are: \n","\n","- Dimentionality Reduction   \n","- Image Compression   \n","- Image Denoising   \n","- Image Generation    \n","- Feature Extraction  \n","\n","\n","\n","### How Autoencoders work \n","\n","Lets understand the mathematics behind autoencoders. The main idea behind autoencoders is to learn a low level repersenation of a high level dimentional data. Lets try to understand the encoding process with an example.  Consider a data repersentation space (N dimentional space which is used to repersent the data) and consider the data points repersented by two variables : x1 and x2. Data Manifold is the space inside the data repersentation space in which the true data resides.

Role of upsampling layer is to upsample the dimentions of a input vector to a higher resolution / dimention. The max pooling operation is non-invertible, however an approximate inverse can be obtained by recording the locations of the maxima within each pooling region. Umsampling layers make use of this property to project the reconstructions from a low dimentional feature space.   \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"a67b7fd1b9751d543801df27db6c1221f8f8a38f","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["input_layer = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))\n","\n","encoded_layer1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_layer)\n","encoded_layer1 = MaxPool2D( (2, 2), padding='same')(encoded_layer1)\n","encoded_layer2 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoded_layer1)\n","encoded_layer2 = MaxPool2D( (2, 2), padding='same')(encoded_layer2)\n","encoded_layer3 = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoded_layer2)\n","latent_view    = MaxPool2D( (2, 2), padding='same')(encoded_layer3)\n","\n","decoded_layer1 = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(latent_view)\n","decoded_layer1 = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(decoded_layer1)\n","decoded_layer2 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(decoded_layer1)\n","decoded_layer2 = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(decoded_layer2)\n","decoded_layer3 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(decoded_layer2)\n","decoded_layer3 = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(decoded_layer3)\n","output_layer   = Conv2D(1, (3, 3), padding='same')(decoded_layer3)\n","\n","model_2 = Model(input_layer, output_layer)\n","model_2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"c945e74a7b0753008aeadf1577e354560f0e48f5"},"source":["Here is the model summary"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"_uuid":"1d2a5b425fd14017e5510b696566e17516a7108a","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["model_2.summary()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"df3ef4d6d93b8ecb712f43e498cf8ddf9f786401"},"source":["Train the model with early stopping callback.

In the previous example we input an image which was a basicaly a 2 dimentional data, in this example we will input a sequence data as the input which will be 1 dimentional. Example of sequence data are time series data and text data. This usecase can be applied in machine translation. Unlike CNNs in image example, in this use-case we will use LSTMs. \n","\n","Most of the code of this section is taken from the following reference shared by Jason Brownie in his blog post.

First lets understand the internal working of LSTMs which will be used in this architecture. \n","\n","- The Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM, is a recurrent neural network that is comprised of internal gates.   \n","- Unlike other recurrent neural networks, the network’s internal gates allow the model to be trained successfully using backpropagation through time, or BPTT, and avoid the vanishing gradients problem.   \n","- We can define the number of LSTM memory units in the LSTM layer, Each unit or cell within the layer has an internal memory / cell state, often abbreviated as “c“, and outputs a hidden state, often abbreviated as “h“.   \n","- By using Keras, we can access both output states of the LSTM layer as well as the current states of the LSTM layers.  \n","\n","Lets now create an autoencoder architecutre for learning and producing sequences made up of LSTM layers. There are two components: \n","\n","- An encoder architecture which takes a sequence as input and returns the current state of LSTM as the output  \n","- A decoder architecture which takes the sequence and encoder LSTM states as input and returns the decoded output sequence\n","- We are saving and accessing hidden and memory states of LSTM so that we can use them while generating predictions on unseen data. \n","\n","Lets first of all, generate a sequence dataset containing random sequences of fixed lengths. We will create a function to generate random sequences. \n","\n","- X1 repersents the input sequence containing random numbers  \n","- X2 repersents the padded sequence which is used as the seed to reproduce the other elements of the sequence  \n","- y repersents the target sequence or the actual sequence
