four advanced features improve accuracy. The first model uses no advanced features. The second uses only the double convolution layer trick. The third uses only the learnable subsambling layer trick. The third model uses both of those techniques plus batch normalization. The last model employs all three of those techniques plus data augmentation and achieves the best accuracy of 99.5%! (Or more if we train longer.)

This makes experiments difficult because each time you run the same experiment, you get different results. Therefore, you must run your experiments dozens of times and take an average. This kernel was run dozens of times and it seems that the best CNN architecture for classifying MNIST handwritten digits is 784 - [32C5-P2] - [64C5-P2] - 128 - 10 with 40% dropout. Afterward, more experiments show that replacing '32C5' with '32C3-32C3' improves accuracy. And replacing 'P2' with '32C5S2' improves accuracy. And adding batch normalizaiton and data augmentation improve the CNN. The best CNN found from the experiments here becomes\n"," *  **784 - [32C3-32C3-32C5S2] - [64C3-64C3-64C5S2] - 128 - 10** \n"," * with 40% dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation added"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Acknowledgments\n","\n","Thanks to [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) for creating [how-to-choose-cnn-architecture-mnist](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/how-to-choose-cnn-architecture-mnist).
