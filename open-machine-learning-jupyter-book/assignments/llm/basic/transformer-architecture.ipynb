    "The encoder-decoder architecture based on the Transformer structure is illustrated in figure below. The left and right sides correspond to the encoder and decoder structures, respectively. They consist of several basic Transformer blocks (represented by the gray boxes in the figure), stacked N times. Each component comprises multiple Transformer blocks, which are stacked N times.\n",

    "Here's an overview of the key components and processes involved in the semantic abstraction process from input to output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder takes an input sequence {xi}ti=1, where each xi represents the representation of a word in the text sequence.\n",
    "It consists of stacked Transformer blocks. Each block includes:\n",
    "Attention Layer: Utilizes multi-head attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between words in the input sequence, facilitating the modeling of long-range dependencies without traditional recurrent structures.\n",
    "Position-wise Feedforward Layer: Applies complex transformations to the representations of each word in the input sequence.\n",
    "Residual Connections: Directly connect the input and output of the attention and feedforward layers, aiding in efficient information flow and model optimization.\n",
    "Layer Normalization: Normalizes the output representations of the attention and feedforward layers, stabilizing optimization.\n",
    "Decoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder generates an output sequence {yi}ti=1 based on the representations learned by the encoder.\n",
    "Similar to the encoder, it consists of stacked Transformer blocks, each including the same components as described above.\n",
    "In addition, the decoder includes an additional attention mechanism that focuses on the encoder's output to incorporate context information during sequence generation.\n",
    "Overall, the encoder-decoder architecture based on the Transformer structure allows for effective semantic abstraction by leveraging attention mechanisms, position-wise feedforward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization. This architecture enables the model to capture complex dependencies between words in the input sequence and generate meaningful outputs for various sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n",
