    "You have seen that we can use quite simple methods to extract information from non-structured data sources, such as text. In this example, we have taken the existing list of medications, but it would be much more powerful to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform entity extraction from text. In [this blog post](https://soshnikov.com/science/analyzing-medical-papers-with-azure-and-text-analytics-for-health/) we describe how to use cloud services for entity extraction. Another option would be using Python NLP libraries such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - an approach for extracting information from text using NLTK is described [here](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html)."
