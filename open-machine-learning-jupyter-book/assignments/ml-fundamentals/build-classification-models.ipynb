    "Accuracy is the commonly used metric in classification problems. It tells how accurate the model is at making correct predictions. Take an example: If your classifier can only recognize 95 images in 100 images, the accuracy is 95%. Accuracy is not an appropriate metric when the dataset is not balanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Precision shows the ability of the classifier to recognize positive samples correctly. The recall is the percentage of positive predictions over all positive samples. There is a tradeoff between precision and recall. Increasing precision will decrease recall and vice versa. And for that reason, we combine both of these metrics into another metric called the F1 score. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both accuracy, precision, and recall can be calculated easily by using a [confusion matrix](https://jeande.tech/how-to-read-a-confusion-matrix). A confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by a classifier in all available classes. It's also important to note that a confusion matrix is not a metric, rather a representation of incorrect/correct positive and negative predictions made by a classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "More intuitively, a confusion matrix is made of 4 main elements: True negatives, false negatives, true positives, and false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* True Positives(TP): Number of samples that are correctly classified as positive, and their actual label is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* False Positives (FP): Number of samples that are incorrectly classified as positive, when in fact their actual label is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* True Negatives (TN): Number of samples that are correctly classified as negative, and their actual label is negative.\n",
