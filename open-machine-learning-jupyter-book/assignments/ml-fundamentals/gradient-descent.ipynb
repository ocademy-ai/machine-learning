    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental concept behind gradient descent is rather straightforward: it involves the gradual adjustment of parameters, such as the slope ($m$) and the intercept ($b$) in our regression equation $y = mx + b, with the aim of minimizing a cost function. This cost function is typically a metric that quantifies the disparity between our model's predicted results and the actual values. In regression scenarios, the widely employed cost function is the `mean squared error` (MSE). When dealing with classification problems, a different set of parameters must be fine-tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE (Mean Squared Error) is mathematically expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $y_i$ represents the actual data points, $\\hat{y_i}$ signifies the predictions made by our model ($mx_i + b$), and $n$ denotes the total number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary challenge is to determine the optimal adjustments to parameters $m$ and $b\" to minimize the MSE effectively."

    "### Partial Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In our pursuit of minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE), we turn to partial derivatives to understand how each individual parameter influences the MSE. The term \"partial\" signifies that we are taking derivatives with respect to individual parameters, in this case, $m$ and $b, separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following formula, which closely resembles the MSE, but now we've introduced the function $f(m, b)$ into it. The addition of this function doesn't significantly alter the essence of the calculation, but it allows us to input specific values for $m$ and $b$ to compute the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(m, b) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - (mx_i+b))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of calculating partial derivatives, we can temporarily disregard the summation and the terms preceding it, focusing solely on the expression $y - (mx + b)^2$. This expression serves as a better starting point for the subsequent partial derivative calculations."

    "### Partial Derivative with Respect to $m$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate the partial derivative with respect to the parameter $m,\" we isolate the parameter $m\" and treat $b$ as a constant (effectively setting it to 0 for differentiation purposes). To compute this derivative, we utilize the chain rule, which is a fundamental concept in calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule is expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x)) * g(x)' \\quad - \\textrm{chain rule} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule is applicable when one function is nested inside another. In this context, the square operation, $()^2$, is the outer function, while $y - (mx + b)$ is the inner function. Following the chain rule, we differentiate the outer function, maintain the inner function as it is, and then multiply it by the derivative of the inner function. Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (y - (mx + b))^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The derivative of $()^2$ is $2()$, just like $x^2$ becomes $2x$.\n",
    "2. We leave the inner function, $y - (mx + b)$, unaltered.\n",
    "3. The derivative of $y - (mx + b)$ with respect to **_m_** is $(0 - x)$, which simplifies to $-x$. This is because both **_y_** and **_b_** are treated as constants (their derivatives are zero), and the derivative of **_mx_** is simply **_x_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's combine these components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2 \\cdot (y - (mx+b)) \\cdot (-x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, we can rearrange this expression by moving the factor of $-x$ to the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -2x \\cdot (y-(mx+b)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final version of our derivative with respect to $m$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial m} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2x_i(y_i - (mx_i+b)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\frac{df}{dm}$ signifies the partial derivative of function $f$ (as previously defined) with respect to the parameter $m$. We can now insert this derivative into our summation to complete the calculation."

    "### Partial Derivative with Respect to $b$\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for computing the partial derivative with respect to the parameter $b\" is analogous to our previous derivation with respect to $m. We still apply the same rules and utilize the chain rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The derivative of $()^2$ is $2()$, which corresponds to how $x^2$ becomes $2x$.\n",
    "2. We leave the inner function, $y - (mx + b)$, unaltered.\n",
    "3. For the derivative of $y - (mx + b)$ with respect to **_b_**, it becomes $(0 - 1)$ or simply $-1.\" This is because both **_y_** and **_mx_** are treated as constants (their derivatives are zero), and the derivative of **_b_** is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consolidate these components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2 \\cdot (y - (mx+b)) \\cdot (-1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -2 \\cdot (y-(mx+b)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final version of our derivative with respect to $b$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2(y_i - (mx_i+b)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the previous case, $\\frac{df}{db}$ represents the partial derivative of function $f$ with respect to the parameter $b\". Inserting this derivative into our summation concludes the computation."

    "### The Final Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into the code, there are a few essential details to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient descent is an iterative process, and with each iteration (referred to as an \"epoch\"), we incrementally reduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE). At each iteration, we apply our derived functions to update the values of parameters $m$ and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because gradient descent is iterative, we must determine how many iterations to perform, or devise a mechanism to stop the algorithm when it approaches the minimum of the MSE. In essence, we continue iterations until the algorithm no longer improves the MSE, signifying that it has reached a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An important parameter in gradient descent is the learning rate ($lr$). The learning rate governs the pace at which the algorithm moves toward the minimum of the MSE. A smaller learning rate results in slower but more precise convergence, while a larger learning rate may lead to faster convergence but may overshoot the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, gradient descent primarily involves the process of taking derivatives and applying them iteratively to minimize a function. These derivatives guide us toward optimizing the parameters $m$ and $b\" in order to minimize the Mean Squared Error."
