    "K-Means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithms. In unsupervised learning, the machine learning model do not get the labels during training. It instead has to figure out the labels itself. It's like learning without instructions. It's like a teacher telling you, \"hey, here are 1000 exercises to use while preparing for a test, the test will be only 5 questions from all of those exercises.\" That can feel like a struggle, you will do all you can to narrow down these 100 exercises to 5. Some questions may be similar, or may be solved by one method, etc..the goal will merely be to narrow down the exercises, while maximizing the chance of passing the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "That type of example can be compared to clustering. The model is given bunch of data (lacking labels) and the job of the model is to find the labels that can be present according to the supplied data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering require the number of clusters to be specified before training. The way this type of algorithm works is beyond the scope of this notebook but here are 3 main steps of how such algorithm work: \n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means will randomly assigns samples of data to initial centroids of all clusters. This step is called initialization. A centroid is also referred to as a cluster center and it is the mean of all the sample of data in a cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It then reassigns the samples to the nearest centroids.\n",
    "* It also find the new centroids of all clusters by taking the mean value of all of the samples assigned to each previous centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last two steps are repeated until the stopping criterion is fulfilled or when difference between the old and new centroids is constant. \n",
