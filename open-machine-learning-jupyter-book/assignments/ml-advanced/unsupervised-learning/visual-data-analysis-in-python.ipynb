    "\n",
    "To start with, visual exploration of data is the first thing one tends to do when dealing with a new task. We do preliminary checks and analysis using graphics and tables to summarize the data and leave out the less important details. It is much more convenient for us, humans, to grasp the main points this way than by reading many lines of raw data. It is amazing how much insight can be gained from seemingly simple charts created with available visualization tools.\n",

    "- High computational complexity. The [implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) in `scikit-learn` is unlikely to be feasible in a real task. If you have a large number of samples, you should try [Multicore-TSNE](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE) instead.\n",
    "- The plot can change a great deal depending on the random seed, which complicates interpretation. [Here](http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) is a good tutorial on t-SNE. In general, you shouldn't make any far-reaching conclusions based on such graphs because it can equate to plain guessing. Of course, some findings in t-SNE pictures can inspire an idea and be confirmed through more thorough research down the line, but that does not happen very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, using t-SNE, you can get a really good intuition for the data. The following is a good paper that shows an example of this for handwritten digits: [Visualizing MNIST](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/).\n",
