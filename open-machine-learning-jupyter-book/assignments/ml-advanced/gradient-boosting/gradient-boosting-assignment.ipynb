Although, tree based models are not based on any of such assumptions, but if we think logic behind these assumptions, we might argue that, if sum of residuals is not 0, then most probably there is some pattern in the residuals of our model which can be leveraged to make our model better.\n","So, the intuition behind gradient boosting algorithm is to leverage the pattern in residuals and strenghten a weak prediction model, until our residuals become randomly distributed. Once we reach a stage that residuals do not have any pattern that could be modeled, we can stop modeling residuals. Algorithmically, we are minimizing our loss function, such that test loss reach it’s minima."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6ff32c7c-669f-4cf6-8bee-8950833f9369","_uuid":"92321ddcadf065a1e813930b77fe3ccc9fe577ef","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib
