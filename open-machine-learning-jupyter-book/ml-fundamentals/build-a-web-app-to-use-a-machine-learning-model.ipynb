    "- **Is it a web app or a mobile app?** If you are building a mobile app or need to use the model in an IoT context, you could use [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) and use the model in an Android or iOS app.\n",
    "- **Where will the model reside?** In the cloud or locally?\n",
    "- **Offline support.** Does the app have to work offline?\n",
    "- **What technology was used to train the model?** The chosen technology may influence the tooling you need to use.\n",
    "  - **Using TensorFlow.** If you are training a model using TensorFlow, for example, that ecosystem provides the ability to convert a TensorFlow model for use in a web app by using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/).\n",
    "  - **Using PyTorch.** If you are building a model using a library such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), you have the option to export it in [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for use in JavaScript web apps that can use the [Onnx Runtime](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/). This option will be explored in a future section for a Scikit-learn-trained model.\n",
    "  - **Using Lobe.ai or Azure Custom Vision.** If you are using an ML SaaS (Software as a Service) system such as [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai/) or [Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) to train a model, this type of software provides ways to export the model for many platforms, including building a bespoke API to be queried in the cloud by your online application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have the opportunity to build an entire Flask web app that would be able to train the model itself in a web browser. This can also be done using TensorFlow.js in a JavaScript context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, since we have been working with Python-based notebooks, let's explore the steps you need to take to export a trained model from such a notebook to a format readable by a Python-built web app."

    "For this task, you need two tools: Flask and Pickle, both of which run on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What's [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)? Defined as a 'micro-framework' by its creators, Flask provides the basic features of web frameworks using Python and a templating engine to build web pages. Take a look at [this Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) to practice building with Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What's [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)? Pickle ðŸ¥’ is a Python module that serializes and de-serializes a Python object structure. When you 'pickle' a model, you serialize or flatten its structure for use on the web. Be careful: pickle is not intrinsically secure, so be careful if prompted to 'un-pickle' a file. A pickled file has the suffix `.pkl`."
