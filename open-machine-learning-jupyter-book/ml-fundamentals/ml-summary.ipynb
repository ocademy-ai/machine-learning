    "Most of supervised machine learning can be looked at using the following framework: \n",
    "You have a set of training points $(x_i, y_i)$, and you want to find a function f that \"fits the data well\", \n",
    "that is, $yi \\approx f(x_i)$ for most $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the form of $f$. For instance, we can define $f = wx + b$, for some constants $w$ and $b$. \n",
    "Note that this is a set of functions — for different values of $w$ and $b$, \n",
    "you will get different functions $f$, and you want to find an $f$\n",
    "from this set that does the “best”.\n",
    "- As you might have noticed, we have been talking about this notion of “best”, \n",
    "which is ill-defined up to this point. So, we need to make this more concrete. \n",
    "The goal here, as stated above, is to have $y_i \\approx f(x_i)$\n",
    "for most $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two steps essentially define the **function class** and the **loss function** respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how you choose your function class and the loss function, \n",
    "you get different supervised learning models or even unsupervised learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear function class with squared-error loss function — Linear regression\n",
    "- Linear function class with logistic loss function — Logistic regression\n",
    "- Linear function class with hinge loss — SVM\n",
    "- Function class containing a network of neurons with cross-entropy loss — Neural networks\n",
