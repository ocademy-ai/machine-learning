    "Can linear regression in machine learning predict the stock market? This real dataset includes stock market data from several major U.S. companies between 2005 and 2020, including daily opening and closing prices, highest and lowest prices, trading volume, turnover rate, and other information. Today, we are going to use it to practice and see if we will make a profit or incur losses.\n",

    "Strange occurrences often have underlying reasons. Let's take a closer look at what y_test in the test set actually looks like. As it turns out, when y_test was created, the order was shuffled. In fact, there's a parameter in sklearn's train_test_split function called 'shuffle,' which is set to 'True' by default. This means that by default, the order is shuffled when splitting the training and test sets.\n",

    "Shuffling the order itself isn't necessarily a problem, but in our daily lives, stock prices generally follow a relatively smooth curve over time. Therefore, the test results may initially appear odd because they don't align with common sense. If we set 'shuffle' to 'False,' we can avoid this situation.

    "Furthermore, if the model we've developed provides accurate predictions at finer granularities, we could potentially engage in multiple trades within those 15 years. Selling all stocks at local highs whenever the price is about to drop and buying in at local lows when the price is about to rise can optimize returns even further.

However, we are not content because there are still deviations between the model's predictions and the actual situation. This has caused us to buy at high points and sell at low points on several occasions. Following the principle that there's no harm in having more money, we aim to further optimize the model using a loss function. Today, let's first learn how to calculate the loss function.\n",

The first one is the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average of the squared differences between **predicted values** and **actual values** on the  **training dataset** .

    "Secondly, their purposes differ; loss functions are primarily used during model training to help the model gradually adjust its parameters to minimize prediction errors. In contrast, evaluation metrics are used to summarize and compare the performance of a trained model, to understand the overall effectiveness of the model, or to compare the performance differences between different models, guiding model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, their optimization directions are different. With loss functions, the goal is typically to minimize them because smaller loss values imply that the predicted values are closer to the actual values. In contrast, for evaluation metrics, the goal is often to maximize their values; for example, in the case of R-squared, higher values indicate better model performance. This difference reflects the distinct roles of loss functions and evaluation metrics in machine learning tasks. \n",

If the algorithm consistently finds a smaller loss function value in each iteration compared to the previous one, the model becomes incrementally more optimized with each round. Consequently, as the number of training epochs increases, the loss function tends to decrease until it stabilizes, and the model's parameters change along with it, ultimately achieving the optimal result.\n",
