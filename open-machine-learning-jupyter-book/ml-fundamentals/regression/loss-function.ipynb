    "\n",
    "Firstly, evaluation metrics include concepts like R-squared and explained variance, which are not present in loss functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, their purposes differ; loss functions are primarily used during model training to help the model gradually adjust its parameters to minimize prediction errors. In contrast, evaluation metrics are used to summarize and compare the performance of a trained model, to understand the overall effectiveness of the model, or to compare the performance differences between different models, guiding model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, their optimization directions are different. With loss functions, the goal is typically to minimize them because smaller loss values imply that the predicted values are closer to the actual values. In contrast, for evaluation metrics, the goal is often to maximize their values; for example, in the case of R-squared, higher values indicate better model performance. This difference reflects the distinct roles of loss functions and evaluation metrics in machine learning tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as mentioned in the previous segment, loss functions are often calculated on the training set, while evaluation metrics are typically computed on the test set, with fewer instances of calculating them on the training set.\n"

    "In essence, we can think of it this way: during the training process of the SGDRegressor model, the algorithm is continually trying to reduce the loss function. In other words, this is the direction of model optimization. Each training round of SGDRegressor results in a new model, which can yield a new loss function value on the training dataset. If the algorithm consistently finds a smaller loss function value in each iteration compared to the previous one, the model becomes incrementally more optimized with each round. Consequently, as the number of training epochs increases, the loss function tends to decrease until it stabilizes, and the model's parameters change along with it, ultimately achieving the optimal result."
