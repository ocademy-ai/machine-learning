    "- a survey may not contain data for some of the optional fields.\n",

    "**Data duplicates** can be in various formats, such as multiple entries of the same data, or repeated values of the identification variable. It not only wastes memory and computing resources but may also lead to data imbalance. Sometimes, duplicate data might be valid in a dataset, but it eventually still arises because of errors during data extraction and integration. Hence, it is important to identify if the duplicate values are intended or invalid values existing in the dataset.\n",

    "**Outlier** is an observation that deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism. It could be either the reflection of the dataset diversity itself or caused by errors and mistakes. Machine Learning algorithms are usually sensitive to the range and distribution of attribute values. Outliers may degrade the model performance by increasing the possibility to misclassify.\n",

    "**Data consistency**. A dataset could be constructed from different data sources. For example, a retailer usually doesn't have a centralized way to manage its supply chain. Instead, it achieves this by combining different ERP systems across demand, supply, shipment, inventory, and so on. Those ERP systems are vend from different software companies which have their solutions to structure and organize the data, e.g. to present timestamp as Unix epoch vs. the ISO format. Consistency data is necessary to build Machine Learning models. It is also important to help data scientists and business owners to have meaningful business analytics."
