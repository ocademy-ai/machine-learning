# Machine Learning productionization

Moving Machine Learning models into production is as important as building them, sometimes even harder. Maintaining data quality and model accuracy over time are just a few of the challenges. To achieve end-to-end system productionization as a whole, the various components and designs need to be identified, from defining a problem to serving the model as a service.

This chapter combines the foundational concepts of machine learning with the functional expertise of modern software development and engineering to help you develop production-ready Machine Learning knowledge.
