    "Machine Learning is not universally applicable. Similar to any other technology, it could only be used to solve certain problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the existing solutions?** Machine Learning may be considered either when a problem is new, or existing non-Machine Learning solutions are not optimized. If it is the former, try solving the problem manually using a [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) approach. Otherwise, the existing non-Machine Learning solution could be leveraged as a benchmark to help you make the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is the error tolerable?** Achieving 100% accuracy in Machine Learning predictions is challenging. Occasionally, the slight possibility of false negatives may be unacceptable. Consider Deep Learning's success in expediting MRI reconstruction compared to conventional methods. Despite the significant enhancement in image quality, the issue of false-negative reconstructions persists and warrants improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is concrete interpretability needed?** Machine learning effectively enhances products, processes, and research, yet computers typically do not articulate their reasoning. The potential issue of the [dark secret at the heart of AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/11/5113/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/) may arise. Conversely, improved explanations could bolster trust in the decision to embrace machine learning. However, this remains a challenge, especially in the context of supervised machine learning, not to mention deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any risk to violate ethics or regulation?**  AI raises significant ethical concerns for society, particularly in the areas of privacy and surveillance, bias, and discrimination. For instance, in the heavily regulated banking industry, algorithm-based lending decisions could lead to systematic discrimination against African Americans and other marginalized consumers.\n",

    "**Are any Machine Learning approaches available?** To create a TikTok alike short video platform, [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/content-moderation/) could help build AI-powered content moderation easily. And [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) is something ready to use for generating transcripts automatically for customers. To [reinvent the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel) is resource-wasting and should be avoided always.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is Machine Learning cost-effective?** The expenses associated with a Machine Learning solution may span various areas, similar to traditional software development, such as cloud services, data, hardware, human resources, maintenance, and more. Additionally, if the team lacks experience in Machine Learning, the additional training costs should be taken into account. When considering Machine Learning as an option, the concept of [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) must be kept in mind. Specifically, the application of machine learning can easily lead to significant ongoing maintenance costs at the system level, including boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undisclosed consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external environment, and various system-level antipatterns."

[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)(GANs) stand out as one of the most popular frameworks for generating synthetic data. For instance, [Ford has combined gaming engines and GANs to create synthetic data for AI training for self-driving](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/04/23/ford-ai-data/). Other approaches to generating synthetic data include statistical distribution fitting, rule-based procedural generation, benchmarks, simulations, and more."

Research has shown that the performance of Machine Learning can increase either monotonically (Banko and Brill, 2001) or logarithmically (Halevy et al., 2009) based on the volume of training data, suggesting that in general, more data is beneficial. However, this is not universally true, as the introduction of more data can also lead to increased noise, which may diminish the quality of the data. Additionally, the availability of large public datasets such as Imagenet and recent advancements in research have reduced the competitive advantage of having access to more data. Therefore, while more data can be advantageous, it is not always the case, and the quality of the data is equally important."

The [COVID-19 Projections](https://covid19-projections.com/) project is typically a batch inference example, which is mentioned in the previous section. Another good example is Facebook News feed generation, which is a complex and time-consuming artificial intelligent process. The News feeds are pre-generated regularly and stored in the cache. Then the web application could request and present the cached feeds in runtime.\n",

The online inference is suitable for more latency-sensitive user scenarios such as search engines and autonomous driving. And it requires speeding up both the inferring and input data sampling. It should be noted that the inference is usually just part of the end-to-end workflow of serving a request from the client side. It will be more challenging if the reference is on the critical path."
