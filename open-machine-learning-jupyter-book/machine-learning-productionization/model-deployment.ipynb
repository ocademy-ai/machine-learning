    "\n",
    "- AWS Data Migration Service and AWS Lake Formation are usually the options for database ingestion, while Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is used for streaming data sources.\n",
    "- S3 is the foundation for the storage layer, and it provides more cost-effective colder-tier storage through Amazon S3 Glacier.\n",
    "- AWS Lake Formation is also the central place to store and manage metadata as the catalog for all datasets in the data lake.\n",
    "- AWS Glue and AWS Step Functions are serverless workflow services to build, orchestrate, and run pipelines.\n",
    "- To consume the processed data, plenty of products are available, such as Redshift, QuickSight, SageMaker, etc.\n",
    "- IAM, KMS, and CloudWatch are the most commonly used AWS services to provide governance capabilities globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pipeline is built on other cloud computing platforms, equivalent services could be easily found across all the layers. The architecture could also be simplified or customized according to the business needs."
