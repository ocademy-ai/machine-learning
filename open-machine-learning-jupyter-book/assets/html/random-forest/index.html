To see how, let's start with one model, a decision tree with an accuracy of 60 percent. <br><br> </p> </section> <section data-index="1" class="condurcet-scrolly"> <p id="two_columns"> <span class="bold">Condorcet's Jury Theorem</span> says that if each person is more than 50% correct, then adding more people to vote increases the probability that the majority is correct.<br><br> True to form, if we ask two more decision trees, each also with 60% accuracy, and decide by the majority vote, then the probability of the vote being right goes up to 65%! </p> </section> <section data-index="2" class="condurcet-scrolly"> <p id="two_columns"> The theorem suggests that the probability of the majority vote being correct can go up as we add more and more models. With eleven models, the majority can reach 75% accuracy! <br><br> There is a caveat. The accuracy may not improve if each model produces the same prediction, for example. The mistake of one model would not be caught by the other models. Therefore, we would want to cast a majority vote using the models that are different. </p> </section> <section data-index="3" class="condurcet-scrolly"> <p id="two_columns"> We can add more and more models. <br><br> <span class="bold">Play with the scrollers yourself!</span> The top controls the number of trees in the ensemble. The bottom controls each tree's accuracy. <br><br> In machine learning, this concept of multiple models working together to come to an aggregate prediction is called <span class="bold">ensemble learning.</span> It provides the basis for many important machine learning models, including random forests. </p> </section> </article> </div> <section id="ensemble" class="one-column"> <h2>Ensemble Learning</h2>  <svg version="1.1" id="emStaticChart" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 1909 645" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1909 645" xml:space="preserve"> <g id="tails"> <circle class="st0" cx="155.5" cy="323.5" r="115"></circle> <text transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 115.3315 335.127)" class="st1 st2"> Data </text> <circle class="st0" cx="1754.5" cy="327.5" r="115"></circle> <text transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 1661.2827 315.127)"> <tspan x="0" y="0" class="st1 st2">Aggregate</tspan> <tspan x="3.36" y="48" class="st1 st2">Prediction</tspan> </text> </g> <g id="brackets"> <path class="st5" d="M302.8,318.2c-4,0-7.3,3.3-7.3,7.3c0,4.1,3.3,7.3,7.3,7.3c8.5,0,15.2,2.8,20.5,8.4c15.4,16.6,13.3,51.3,13.3,52.2V487

Condorcet’s Jury Theorem suggests that the majority vote aggregation can have better accuracy than the individual models. There are other methods to aggregate predictions, such as weighted majority vote. </p> <br> <p> Random Forest is an example of ensemble learning where each model is a decision tree. In the next section, we will build a random forest model to classify if a road sign is a pedestrian crossing sign or not. These signs come in many variations, and we will use four simple features: Size, number of sides, number of colors used, and if the sign has text or symbol. <br><br> We will start with a sampling method called the <span class="bold">Bagging Method</span> to create multiple samples from the training data to build each tree. </p> </section> <section id="random-forest"> <h2>Random Forest</h2> <div id="scrolly-rf"> <figure id="figure-rf"> <svg id="chart-rf"></svg> </figure> <article id="article-rf"> <section data-index="0" class="rf-scrolly"> <h3>Bagging Method</h3> <p id="two_columns"> One way to produce multiple models that are different is to train each model using a different training set.

This is good news: The random forest models perform better when the trees in the forest are different. Let's dive deep into this! </p> </section> </article> </div> </section> <section id="barcode" class="one-column"> <h2>Variance in Composition</h2> <br> <p> We previously discussed <a href="https://mlu-explain.github.io/decision-tree/">how decision tree model suffers from high variance.</a> However, this variance among trees is employed in the random forest as a feature, not a bug. The inventor of the random forest model Leo Breiman says in his paper <i>"[o]ur results indicate that better (lower generalization error) random forests have lower correlation between classifiers and higher strength."</i> [Random Forest Article] <br><br> The high variance of the decision tree model can help keep the correlation among trees low. The Bagging Method as well as the Feature Selection are the key innovations to keep correlation low. <br><br> We've just shown how to construct random forests for a given dataset, but how different are our trees from one another in reality? To find out, we've trained a nine-tree random forest on our sign dataset and plotted it below. <br><br> The outer enclosing circle represents the random forest. Each inner circle represents a unique decision tree in the forest. Hovering over a tree will highlight the tree's classification accuracy, and its feature importances* for four features. </p> <div id="barcode-chart"></div> <br> <br><br> <p> Observe that each tree has a fairly unique combination of feature importances and accuracy and there is no obvious pattern. Some trees only use two out of four features, and the tree with similar feature importances as the random forest model still performs much worse than the forest. As discussed in Condorcet's theorem, the key takeaway is the power these models employ when aggregated together in a smart way, as shown by the random forest model having the highest accuracy. </p> <br> <p> As expected, the random forest model (the red dots on the right) performs better than any individual tree. Notice the wide range of the feature importance scores across our trees, which can contribute to low correlation. In the very first random forest visualization tool developed by Breiman, he also attempted to show the range in feature importances. </p> </section> <section id="cantor-section" class="one-column"> <h2>Variance in Predictions</h2> <br> <p> If each tree produces the same prediction, then the accuracy can not improve. Below, each circle represents a prediction from a model. Circles in the same row share the same model, while circles in the same column share the same test data. Blue means "Yes" and pink means "No". Solid color means that the prediction is correct, while the strip means that the prediction is incorrect. Not all test data points are shown. </p> <div id="cantor-wrapper"> <div id="chart-wrapper-cantor"> <div class="chart" id="cantor-treegrid"></div> <div class="chart" id="cantor-scatter"></div> </div> </div> <p> The irregular pattern in the grid shows how the trees are different in where they make mistakes. As expected, the random forest model performs the best overall even if there are trees with very low accuracy. Note that for the first data point (first column), there are still three trees with the correct prediction while the majority is incorrect. This inspired people to consider other methods, such as Boosting, which is very popular today. </p> </section> <section id="conclusion" class="one-column"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p> Random Forest models are a popular model for a large number of tasks. In short, it's a method to produce aggregated predictions using the predictions from several decision trees. The old theorem of Condorcet suggests that the majority vote from several weak models with more than 50% accuracy may do the trick. Later, Breiman came up with Bagging and Feature Selection that helps to keep correlation among the trees low which is a key to success. <br><br> There has been some theory built around the bias and variance of random forest model in relation to the trees that it has.
