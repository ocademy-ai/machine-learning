    "In the realm of deep learning, several common activation functions are widely used due to their impact on network training and performance. Here are some prevalent activation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Activation):**\n",
    "ReLU is one of the most commonly used activation functions. It sets negative input values to zero and keeps positive values unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\max(0, x) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem and computes faster. However, it can cause neurons to \"die\" by setting negative outputs to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sigmoid Function:**\n",
    "The sigmoid function maps inputs to the range (0, 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often used in binary classification problems at the output layer but suffers from the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks.\n",

    "**3. Tanh Function:**\n",
    "Tanh function maps inputs to the range (-1, 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the sigmoid function but outputs in the range (-1, 1), aiding zero-centered data. However, it also faces the issue of vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Leaky ReLU:**\n",
    "Leaky ReLU is an improvement over ReLU, allowing a small slope for negative input values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\ \\alpha x & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\alpha$ is a small positive number. This function addresses the \"neuron death\" problem in ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
