    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to develop more intuitive understanding of why deep learning has became so popular. Let's say that as an Engineer, you are asked by your city state to build a program that can recognize car and truck moving in a given road. The program can later be deployed in a less loads-road to warn trucks that pass there that the road was not designed for these types of vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "With normal programming, you would have to provide and to write all instructions (codes) of that particular program. The chance (close to reality) is that it would be hard, mostly because there are different types of cars and trucks and each can be unique in its ways, which can make it hard to write the rules forming such program. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can deep learning solve that? Well, by feeding the images of cars and trucks to a deep learning model, say a convolutional neural network (more on this latter), it can learn the underlying features of cars and trucks, and thus will be able to recognize each and each. We will see this in practice in later notebooks.\n",
