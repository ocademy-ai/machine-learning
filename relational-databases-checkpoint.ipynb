    "# Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are you have used a spreadsheet in the past to store information. You had a set of rows and columns, where the rows contained the information (or data), and the columns described the information (sometimes called metadata). A relational database is built upon this core principle of columns and rows in tables, allowing you to have information spread across multiple tables. This allows you to work with more complex data, avoid duplication, and have flexibility in the way you explore the data. Let's explore the concepts of a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## It all starts with tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database has at its core tables. Just as with the spreadsheet, a table is a collection of columns and rows. The row contains the data or information we wish to work with, such as the name of a city or the amount of rainfall. The columns describe the data they store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin our exploration by starting a table to store information about cities. We might start with their name and country. You could store this in a table as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City     | Country       |\n",
    "| -------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| Tokyo    | Japan         |\n",
    "| Atlanta  | United States |\n",
    "| Auckland | New Zealand   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the column names of `city`, `country` and `population` describe the data being stored, and each row has information about one city.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The shortcomings of a single table approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are, the table above seems relatively familiar to you. Let's start to add some additional data to our burgeoning database - annual rainfall (in millimeters). We'll focus on the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. If we were to add it for Tokyo, it might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City  | Country | Year | Amount |\n",
    "| ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ |\n",
    "| Tokyo | Japan   | 2020 | 1690   |\n",
    "| Tokyo | Japan   | 2019 | 1874   |\n",
    "| Tokyo | Japan   | 2018 | 1445   |\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you notice about our table? You might notice we're duplicating the name and country of the city over and over. That could take up quite a bit of storage, and is largely unnecessary to have multiple copies of. After all, Tokyo has just one name we're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's try something else. Let's add new columns for each year:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City     | Country       | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n",
    "| -------- | ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n",
    "| Tokyo    | Japan         | 1445 | 1874 | 1690 |\n",
    "| Atlanta  | United States | 1779 | 1111 | 1683 |\n",
    "| Auckland | New Zealand   | 1386 | 942  | 1176 |\n",
    "\n",
    "While this avoids the row duplication, it adds a couple of other challenges. We would need to modify the structure of our table each time there's a new year. Additionally, as our data grows having our years as columns will make it trickier to retrieve and calculate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we need multiple tables and relationships. By breaking apart our data we can avoid duplication and have more flexibility in how we work with our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The concepts of relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to our data and determine how we want to split things up. We know we want to store the name and country of our cities, so this will probably work best in one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| City     | Country       |\n",
    "| -------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| Tokyo    | Japan         |\n",
    "| Atlanta  | United States |\n",
    "| Auckland | New Zealand   |\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we create the next table, we need to figure out how to reference each city. We need some form of an identifier, ID or (in technical database terms) a primary key. A primary key is a value used to identify one specific row in a table. While this could be based on a value itself (we could use the name of the city, for example), it should almost always be a number or other identifier. We don't want the id to ever change as it would break the relationship. You will find in most cases the primary key or id will be an auto-generated number.\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "With our cities table created, let's store the rainfall. Rather than duplicating the full information about the city, we can use the id. We should also ensure the newly created table has an *id* column as well, as all tables should have an id or primary key.\n",

    "Relational databases are centered around dividing information between multiple tables which is then brought back together for display and analysis.

You have seen the core concepts of a relational database, and how to perform a join between two tables.\n",
