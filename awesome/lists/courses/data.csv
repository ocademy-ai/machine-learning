,Introduction to Deep Learning,https://c.d2l.ai/berkeley-stat-157/,"This class provides a practical introduction to deep learning, including theoretical motivations and how to implement it in practice. As part of the course we will cover multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, automatic differentiation, and stochastic gradient descent. Moreover, we introduce convolutional networks for image processing, starting from the simple LeNet to more recent architectures such as ResNet for highly accurate models. Secondly, we discuss sequence models and recurrent networks, such as LSTMs, GRU, and the attention mechanism. Throughout the course we emphasize efficient implementation, optimization and scalability, e.g. to multiple GPUs and to multiple machines. The goal of the course is to provide both a good understanding and good ability to build modern nonparametric estimators. The entire course is based on Jupyter notebooks to allow students to gain experience quickly.

本课程将从零开始教授深度学习。同学们只需要有基础的Python编程和数学基础。我们将覆盖四大类模型：多层感知机、卷积神经网络、循环神经网络、和注意力机制。在此之上，我们将介绍深度学习中的两大应用领域—计算机视觉和自然语言处理—中的典型任务。

本课程的一大特点是不仅讲述模型算法，同时会将每一处细节都讲述如何用PyTorch进行实现。这样同学们可以在真实数据上获得第一手经验。我们将举办四次课程竞赛，让同学们实践学习到的知识如何解决实际问题。

,Practical Machine Learning,https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/,"Applying Machine Learning (ML) to solve real problems accurately and robustly requires more than just training the latest ML model. First, you will learn practical techniques to deal with data. This matters since real data is often not independently and identically distributed. It includes detecting covariate, concept, and label shifts, and modeling dependent random variables such as the ones in time series and graphs. Next, you will learn how to efficiently train ML models, such as tuning hyper-parameters, model combination, and transfer learning. Last, you will learn about fairness and model explainability, and how to efficiently deploy models. This class will teach both statistics, algorithms and code implementations.

,Dive into Deep Learning,https://c.d2l.ai/gtc2020/,"Deep learning is transforming the world nowadays. However, realizing deep learning presents unique challenges because any single application brings together various disciplines. Applying deep learning requires simultaneously understanding:

1. the engineering required to train models efficiently, navigating the pitfalls of numerical computing and getting the most out of available hardware;
  
2. the mathematics of a given modeling approach;
  
3. the optimization algorithms for fitting the models to data;
  
4. and the experience of choosing proper hyperparameters for the solution.
