c1cd6816-b243-4a17-8ac3-af6e33e584fc,Deep Learning Tutorial,"This tutorial will teach you the main ideas of Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning. By working through it, you will also get to implement several feature learning/deep learning algorithms, get to see them work for yourself, and learn how to apply/adapt these ideas to new problems.

This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of machine learning (specifically, familiarity with the ideas of supervised learning, logistic regression, gradient descent). If you are not familiar with these ideas, we suggest you go to this Machine Learning course and complete sections II, III, IV (up to Logistic Regression) first.

,Machine Learning for Beginners,"Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum all about Machine Learning. In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called classic machine learning, using primarily Scikit-learn as a library and avoiding deep learning, which is covered in our forthcoming 'AI for Beginners' curriculum. Pair these lessons with our 'Data Science for Beginners' curriculum, as well!

Travel with us around the world as we apply these classic techniques to data from many areas of the world. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment, and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.",,,,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/k7o7tg1gp306q4?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott,machine learning,12,Microsoft,learn.microsoft.com/,en_US,intermediate,"data science,machine learning",,,

,Neural Networks: Zero to Hero,"A course by Andrej Karpathy on building neural networks, from scratch, in code.
We start with the basics of backpropagation and build up to modern deep neural networks, like GPT. In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models.
Prerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian).
