# Style guide

## In general

* Be precise, clear, engaging, pragmatic, and consistent

## Text

Use warm, inclusive language (such as ‚Äúthem‚Äù, even when referring to a single person). Stick to simple language, as many of the readers/contributors may not be native English speakers. You could leverage tools like [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to help with spelling and grammar checks.

* Chapters and Sections
  * Provide an overview at the beginning of each chapter.
  * Be consistent in the structure of each section.
    * Add a copyright section at the beginning wrapped by `<detail>` if needed. E.g. <details>
      <summary><b>LICENSE</b></summary>

      MIT License

      Copyright (c) 2018 Author 1
      Copyright (c) 2018 Author 2

      ...
      </details>
    * `## Your turn! üöÄ` for exercises/assignments.
    * `## Self study` for further reading resources.
    * `## Acknowledgments` if needed.
    * Add [bibliography](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html?highlight=docname%20in%20docnames#citations) by using the JupyterBook built-in way.
  * Only capitalize the first letter.
* Don't add the URL as plain text. Instead, add it as a [preview](https://link-previews.stephanbogner.de/).
* Quotes - use double quotes
* Symbol descriptions - timestep tÔºànot t timestepÔºâ
* Use numerals when they are explaining or part of code or math.
* Acceptable abbreviations
  * AI, MLP, CNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM, model names (e.g., ELMo, GPT, BERT)
  * We spell out full names in some cases to be clear (e.g., NLP -> natural language processing)

## Math

* Be consistent in [math notation](./NOTATION.md)
* Place punctuations within equations if necessary
  * e.g., comma and period
* Assignment symbol
  * \leftarrow
* Use mathematical numerals only when they are part of math: "$x$ is either $1$ or $-1$", "the greatest common divisor of $12$ and $18$ is $6$".
* We do not use "thousands separator" (since different publishing houses have different styles). E.g., 10,000 should be written as 10000 in the source markdown files.

## Figure

* Software
  * [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), add/edit the `.draw.io` file in the `./drawio` folder.
    * [Example-diagrams](https://www.diagrams.net/example-diagrams) as a quick reference.
  * Follow [this](https://opencomputinglab.github.io/SubjectMatterNotebooks/diagram/overview.html) for mermaid, wavedrom, plantuml, tikz, blockdiag.
  * Add inline [quiz](https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js).
* Be careful about **COPYRIGHT**. Add the reference inline by using the [markdown figure format](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/figures.html#markdown-figures).
* Always add the link to the original source.
* Style(optional)
  * SizeÔºö
    * HorizontalÔºö<= 400 pixels  (limited by page width)
    * VerticalÔºö<= 200 pixels (exceptions may be made)
  * ThicknessÔºö
    * StickArrow
    * 1pt
    * arrowhead size: 50%
  * FontÔºö
    * Arial (for text), STIXGeneral (for math), 9ptÔºàsubscripts/superscriptsÔºö6ptÔºâ
    * Do not italicize numbers or parentheses in subscripts or superscripts
  * ColorÔºö
White as the background (text is black)
  * (Try to avoid) Extra DarkÔºö#3FA3FD
  * DarkÔºö#66BFFF
  * LightÔºö#B2D9FF
  * (Try to avoid) Extra Light: #CFF4FF

One way to add a figure is to use `figure-md` as below:

```text
:::{figure-md} figure_label
<img src="path/to/your/figure/file" width="90%" class="bg-white mb-1">

Caption for the figure (markdown is supported for hyperlinks, references, etc.)
:::
```

The other way is to use `{figure}`. For example:

<pre>
```{figure} path/to/your/figure/file
---
name: 'figure_label'
width: 90%
---
Caption for the figure (markdown is supported for hyperlinks, references, etc.)
```
</pre>

Typically, we set the width to `90%`. However, for some smaller figures, you could change that to other values such as `50%` or `30%`.

## Code

* Python
  * Please use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) as the default lint formatter. You can [format the active cell on VScode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65747615/how-to-format-jupyter-notebook-in-vscode) by using [Black plugin](https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0).
  * Please follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) where the lint static checking does not cover, e.g. the naming convention.
* Markdown - please refer to [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), where you can find the command line tool and VSCode plugin.

## Assignment

Please follow below to elaborate the test content.

1. Keep the BEST accessibility. The assignment must be executable at any Jupyter environment with no need to install any additional dependencies.
   1. The assignment manages the dependencies itself.
      1. Install necessary dependencies at the beginning of the notebook.
        ```
         # install the necessary dependencies
         import sys
         !{sys.executable} - m pip install - -quiet numpy
         ```
   2. Don't use Jupyter Book specific syntax for assignment.
2. Clear all the output before you submit the PR.
3. Use separate PRs for assignment content, unit test and questions.
4. Follow the same way as the text content to add copyright statement and acknowledgement.
5. If hint is necessary, follow below style to add.
   1. ```html
        <div class="alert alert-info">
          
        <details><summary>üë©‚Äçüíª <b>Hint</b></summary>

        This is the hint content.

        </details>

        </div>
        ```

### TDD style

You can follow the [Small diabetes study](open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/assignments/data-science/small-diabetes-study.ipynb) assignment as an example to add unit test if TDD style assignment code is applicable.

<div class="admonition note" name="html-admonition">
How to modify the <a src=https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/metadata.html#adding-tags-using-notebook-interfaces>metadata</a> of Jupyter Notebook?
</div>

1. Add below as the precursor node of the test.
   1. `<h5><font color=blue>Check result by executing below... üìù</font></h5>`
2. Set the necessary metadata of the unit test code cell.
   1. Set `hide-input` [tag](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/hiding.html#hide-cell-inputs) for hiding the test content in Jupuyter Book.
   2. Set `"jupyter": { "source_hidden": true }` to auto hide the test content in Jupyter Lab.
   3. Set `"editable": false` to block editing.
3. Make sure all the tests could be passed.

## Data

If sample data is needed for the book or assignments, first try to use built-in ones from [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html) or [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) if possible.

To introduce your own dataset, put the data file into the `./assets/data` folder, then it could be referred to by a relative path. You can also add Python code, binary, and any other type of static asserts.

## Slides

The project's slide source code is hosted in `open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/slides/`. If you want to add or edit any slide, please refer to the demo and example code [here](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE). The slideshow functionality is powered by [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), and you could find the detailed documentation there.

## References

* Refer to [jupyterbook - References and cross-references](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/references.html) on how to add references for figures, tables and equations.

## Citations

1\. Use [zoterobib](https://zbib.org/) to generate consistent keys for bibtex entries. Please keep the format to be consistent with zoterobib if you prefer any other bib management tools.

2\. Add the bibtex entry to `references.bib` on the root directory. Such as below,

```bibtext
@article{wood2011sequence,
  title={The sequence memoizer},
  author={Wood, Frank and Gasthaus, Jan and Archambeau, C{\'e}dric and James, Lancelot and Teh, Yee Whye},
  journal={Communications of the ACM},
  volume={54},
  number={2},
  pages={91--98},
  year={2011},
  publisher={ACM}
}
```

3\. In the text, use the following to cite the added paper:

```markdown
{cite}`Wood.Gasthaus.Archambeau.ea.2011`
```

## Appendix

* [How to give attribution? | Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/attribution/)

## HTML snippets

1\. Put the folder containing your HTML/CSS/Javascript files under `assets/html/`. For example:

```output
assets/
    html/
        my-html-folder/
            js/      
            css/
            index.html
```

2\. To include the `index.html` file as an HTML `iframe` in the Markdown file, simply use:

```html
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <iframe src="../assets/html/my-html-folder/my-file.html" width="105%" height="700px;" style="border:none;"></iframe>
  Caption of the iframe. <a href="source/of/the/iframe">[source]</a>
</p>
```

Note that we may need to set the `width` to `105%` so that all content of `index.html` will be rendered correctly. Also, the `height` has to be set manually.

## YouTube video

To include a YouTube video:

```html
<div class="yt-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUyec4eCEiY" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

Here `YUyec4eCEiY` is the YouTube `id` of the video, and you should change it accordingly.

How does it work? In fact, the `class="yt-container"` is set to use the CSS style defined in `open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/_static/youtube.css`. This `youtube.css` file will be included in every generated HTML file of Jupyter Book.
