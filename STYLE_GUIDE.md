## General

### Code

* Python
  * Please use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) as the default lint formatter. You can [format the active cell on VScode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65747615/how-to-format-jupyter-notebook-in-vscode) by using [Black plugin](https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0).
  * Please follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) where the lint static checking does not cover, e.g. the naming convention.
* Markdown - please refer to [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), where you can find the command line tool and VSCode plugin.
