,"Spinning Up in Deep Reinforcement Learning ",https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/,"Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL! This is an educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

For the unfamiliar: [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) is a machine learning approach for teaching agents how to solve tasks by trial and error. Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with [deep learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/).

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

* a short [introduction](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
* an [essay](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,
* a [curated list](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,
* a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,

,Introduction to Deep Learning,https://c.d2l.ai/berkeley-stat-157/,"This class provides a practical introduction to deep learning, including theoretical motivations and how to implement it in practice. As part of the course we will cover multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, automatic differentiation, and stochastic gradient descent. Moreover, we introduce convolutional networks for image processing, starting from the simple LeNet to more recent architectures such as ResNet for highly accurate models. Secondly, we discuss sequence models and recurrent networks, such as LSTMs, GRU, and the attention mechanism. Throughout the course we emphasize efficient implementation, optimization and scalability, e.g. to multiple GPUs and to multiple machines. The goal of the course is to provide both a good understanding and good ability to build modern nonparametric estimators. The entire course is based on Jupyter notebooks to allow students to gain experience quickly.

Do you want to build image classifiers, NLP apps, train on many GPUs or even on many machines? If you’re an engineer or data scientist, this course is for you. This is about the equivalent of a Coursera course, all packed into one day. The course consists of four segments of 90 minutes each.

1. Deep Learning Basics
2. Convolutional Neural Networks for computer vision
3. Best practices (GPUs, Parallelization, Fine Tuning, Transfer Learning)

,动手学深度学习在线课程,https://c.d2l.ai/zh-v2/,"不论是在学术突破还是在工业应用， 深度学习是人工智能在近十年里进展最为迅速的领域。然而，深度学习模型复杂、参数繁多、而且新模型层出不穷，这给学习带来了难度。

本课程将从零开始教授深度学习。同学们只需要有基础的Python编程和数学基础。我们将覆盖四大类模型：多层感知机、卷积神经网络、循环神经网络、和注意力机制。在此之上，我们将介绍深度学习中的两大应用领域—计算机视觉和自然语言处理—中的典型任务。

本课程的一大特点是不仅讲述模型算法，同时会将每一处细节都讲述如何用PyTorch进行实现。这样同学们可以在真实数据上获得第一手经验。我们将举办四次课程竞赛，让同学们实践学习到的知识如何解决实际问题。

课程内容将紧靠《动手学深度学习》第二版。本书目前已经被近200所大学采用作为教材。我们将在3月20日开始直播。同学们无需注册或缴费就可以参加。敬请期待。",,,Mu Li,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mulicmu/,free,0,deep learning,,D2L,https://d2l.ai/,self-paced,false,zh_CN,advanced,"deep learning,video,machine learning,projects",,2021-03-01,2023-08-08T00:43:06T+0830,2023-08-08T00:43:06T+0830
,Practical Machine Learning,https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/,"Applying Machine Learning (ML) to solve real problems accurately and robustly requires more than just training the latest ML model. First, you will learn practical techniques to deal with data. This matters since real data is often not independently and identically distributed. It includes detecting covariate, concept, and label shifts, and modeling dependent random variables such as the ones in time series and graphs. Next, you will learn how to efficiently train ML models, such as tuning hyper-parameters, model combination, and transfer learning. Last, you will learn about fairness and model explainability, and how to efficiently deploy models. This class will teach both statistics, algorithms and code implementations. Homeworks and the final project emphasize solving real problems.",,,"Alex Smola,Mu Li,Qingqing Huang","https://alex.smola.org/,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mulicmu/,https://www.linkedin.com/in/qingqing-huang-18a329138/",free,0,deep learning,,Stanford,https://www.stanford.edu/,self-paced,false,en_US,advanced,"deep learning,machine learning,projects",,2021-09-01,2023-08-08T00:43:06T+0830,2023-08-08T00:43:06T+0830
,Dive into Deep Learning,https://c.d2l.ai/gtc2020/,"Deep learning is transforming the world nowadays. However, realizing deep learning presents unique challenges because any single application brings together various disciplines. Applying deep learning requires simultaneously understanding:

1. the engineering required to train models efficiently, navigating the pitfalls of numerical computing and getting the most out of available hardware;
  
2. the mathematics of a given modeling approach;
  
3. the optimization algorithms for fitting the models to data;
  
4. and the experience of choosing proper hyperparameters for the solution.
  

To fulfill the strong wishes of simpler but more practical deep learning materials, [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/), a unified resource of deep learning was born to achieve the following goals:

* Offering depth theory and runnable code, showing readers how to solve problems in practice;
  
* Allow for rapid updates, both by us, and also by the community at large;
  
* Be complemented by a forum for interactive discussions of technical details and to answer questions;
  
* Be freely available for everyone.",,,"Rachel Hu,Aston Zhang","https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelsonghu/,https://www.astonzhang.com/",free,0,deep learning,,GTC,https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/,self-paced,false,en_US,intermediate,"deep learning,machine learning,projects",,2020-10-01,2023-08-08T00:43:06T+0830,2023-08-08T00:43:06T+0830
