    "# 10 Must-Know OOP Concepts in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to structure their code in a modular and reusable manner. Python, being an object-oriented programming language, provides robust support for OOP concepts. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code. \n",

    "In this article, we will explore 10 must-know OOP concepts in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of OOP in Python are classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes encapsulate data and behavior into a single entity, allowing you to create multiple instances with distinct attributes and methods. Here's an example:"

    "## 2. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods within a class. It allows you to hide the internal implementation details of a class and only expose necessary information to the outside world. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and enhances code security and maintainability. Here's an example:"

    "## 3. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class, allowing code reuse and promoting the concept of hierarchy. In Python, multiple inheritance is supported, where a class can inherit from multiple base classes. Here's an example:"

    "\n",
    "## 5. Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows you to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It is achieved by defining abstract classes or interfaces that provide a common interface for derived classes. Python doesn't have built-in support for abstract classes, but it can be achieved using the `abc` module. Here's an example:"
