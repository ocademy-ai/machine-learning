    "Moving Machine Learning models into production is as important as building them, sometimes even harder. Maintaining data quality and model accuracy over time are just a few of the challenges. To achieve end-to-end system productionization as a whole, the various components and designs need to be identified, from defining a problem to serving the model as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter combines the foundational concepts of Machine Learning with the functional expertise of modern software development and engineering to help you develop production-ready Machine Learning knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Productionization of a Machine Learning solution is not a one-time thing. It is always under improving one-time through the iterative process continuously.\n",

    "To bring a Machine Learning solution to production successfully, the first step is to define a valuable business objective and translate the objective into a Machine Learning solvable problem.\n",

    "**[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) Projections{cite}`COVID_19_Projections`** is an artificial intelligence solution to accurately forecast infections, deaths, and recovery timelines of the COVID-19/coronavirus pandemic in the US and globally. By the end of April 2020, it was cited by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) as one of the first models to “help inform public health decision making”.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "I began estimating true infections in November 2020 because I couldn’t find any good models that were doing that in real-time during a critical moment in the pandemic (though there were 30+ models for forecasting deaths)... My goal when I started covid19-projections.com was to create the most accurate COVID-19 model.\n",

    "There have been three separate iterations of the covid19-projections.com model, which are Death Forecasts,\n",
    "Infections Estimates, and Vaccination Projections. We will use the [Death Forecasting model](https://covid19-projections.com/model-details/) as an example to explore how to frame a Machine Learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with answering some Problem Framing related basic questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the inputs?\n",
    "   1. time-series table of death data with geography and demography information. For example to United Status, each row of the data needs to have **a number of deaths $x$ at date $y$ in the region $z$**.\n",
    "2. What are the outputs?\n",
    "   1. **a number of deaths $x'$ at a given future date $y'$ in region $z'$**.\n",
    "3. What are the metrics to measure the success of the project? Such as,\n",
    "   1. projection accuracy, precision, etc. - comparing with existing Machine Learning models and real-world data,\n",
    "   2. model inference speed - comparing with existing Machine Learning models,\n",
    "   3. etc.\n",
    "4. What are the system architecture and required infrastructure?\n",
    "   1. a data pipeline to refresh the input data regularly,\n",
    "   2. a Machine Learning pipeline to regularly iterate the model by using the latest input data,\n",
    "   3. an event schedule module to manage the system communication and collaboration,\n",
    "   4. and a website to show the projected results and be accessible in real-time.\n",
    "5. Any other questions? Such as,\n",
    "   1. is the data generally available and easy to access,\n",
    "   2. what are the existing solutions,\n",
    "   3. etc.\n",

    "## Data engineering\n",

    "### Data ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 Projections Death Forecasting model uses the daily death total provided by [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series), which is considered by experts to be the “gold standard” reference data. It sometimes uses US testing data from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) in our research and graphs. Below is a piece of sample data from CSSE."

    "The training of the Death Forecasting model is basically a Grid Search process. It is found that the brute-force Grid Search method that iterates through the entire parameter space is the most effective in finding an optimal set of parameters. So if there are $10$ values for one parameter and $10$ values for another parameter. Then there are $100$ different parameter combinations for those two parameters. For parameters not able to be estimated as lacking data, the values are considered all equally, resulting in a wider confidence interval.\n",
