As shown in the image, keep in mind that to a computer an image is represented as one large 3-dimensional array of numbers. In this example, the cat image is 248 pixels wide, 400 pixels tall, and has three color channels Red,Green,Blue (or RGB for short). Therefore, the image consists of 248 x 400 x 3 numbers, or a total of 297,600 numbers. Each number is an integer that ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Our task is to turn this quarter of a million numbers into a single label, such as “cat”."

The design idea of VGG is to increase the depth of the network and use a small size convolutional kernel instead. As shown in the figure below, three 3×3 convolutional kernels are used to replace the 7×7 convolutional kernels in AlexNet, and two 3×3 convolutional kernels are used to replace the 5×5 convolutional kernels, which can increase the depth of the network and improve the model effect while ensuring the same perceptual field. The number of model parameters and operations can be reduced by using smaller 3×3 Filters, and the image feature information can be better retained. The specific advantages of the improvement are summarized as follows. "

    "ResNet (Residual Network) was proposed by Kaiming He and won the 2015 ILSVRC Grand Prix with an error rate of 3.57%. In the previous network, when the model is not deep enough, its network recognition is not strong, but when the network stack (Plain Network) is very deep, the network gradient disappearance and gradient dispersion are obvious, resulting in the model's computational effectiveness but not up but down. Therefore, in view of the degradation problem of this deep network, ResNet is designed as an ultra-deep network without the gradient vanishing problem.ResNet has various types depending on the number of layers, from 18 to 1202 layers. As an example, Res Net50 consists of 49 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer, as shown in the figure below. This simple addition does not add additional parameters and computation to the network, but can greatly increase the training speed and improve the training effect, and this simple structure can well solve the degradation problem when the model deepens the number of layers. In this way, the network will always be in the optimal state and the performance of the network will not decrease with increasing depth."

In DenseNet, each layer is connected (concat) with all the preceding layers in the channel dimension and used as input to the next layer, which is a dense connection.

Inspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, they experiment with applying a standard Transformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modifications. To do so, they split an image into patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a Transformer. Image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. They train the model on image classification in supervised fashion."
