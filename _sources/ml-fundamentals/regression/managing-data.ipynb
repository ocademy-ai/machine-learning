    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are set up with the tools you need to start tackling machine learning model building with Scikit-learn, you are ready to start asking questions of your data. As you work with data and apply ML solutions, it's very important to understand how to ask the right question to properly unlock the potentials of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to prepare your data for model-building.\n",
    "- How to use Matplotlib for data visualization.\n",

    "## Asking the right question of your data\n",
    "\n",
    "The question you need answered will determine what type of Machine Learning algorithms you will leverage. And the quality of the answer you get back will be heavily dependent on the nature of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the [data](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/blob/main/2-Regression/data/US-pumpkins.csv) provided for this section. You can open this .csv file in VS Code. A quick skim immediately shows that there are blanks and a mix of strings and numeric data. There's also a strange column called 'Package' where the data is a mix between 'sacks', 'bins' and other values. The data, in fact, is a bit of a mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it is not very common to be gifted a dataset that is completely ready to use to create a Machine Learning model out of the box. In this section, you will learn how to prepare a raw dataset using standard Python libraries. You will also learn various techniques to visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case study: 'the pumpkin market'\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find a .csv file in the root `/assest/data/` folder called [US-pumpkins.csv](../../assets/data/US-pumpkins.csv) which includes 1757 lines of data about the market for pumpkins, sorted into groupings by city. This is raw data extracted from the [Specialty Crops Terminal Markets Standard Reports](https://www.marketnews.usda.gov/mnp/fv-report-config-step1?type=termPrice) distributed by the United States Department of Agriculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing data\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is in the public domain. It can be downloaded in many separate files, per city, from the USDA web site. To avoid too many separate files, we have concatenated all the city data into one spreadsheet, thus we have already _prepared_ the data a bit. Next, let's take a closer look at the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The pumpkin data - early conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you notice about this data? You already saw that there is a mix of strings, numbers, blanks and strange values that you need to make sense of.\n",
    "\n",
    "What question can you ask of this data, using a Regression technique? What about \"Predict the price of a pumpkin for sale during a given month\". Looking again at the data, there are some changes you need to make to create the data structure necessary for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - analyze the pumpkin data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), (the name stands for `Python Data Analysis`) a tool very useful for shaping data, to analyze and prepare this pumpkin data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, check for missing dates\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first need to take steps to check for missing dates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the dates to a month format (these are US dates, so the format is `MM/DD/YYYY`).\n",
    "2. Extract the month to a new column.\n",

    "According to [The Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-much-is-a-bushel-1389308), a bushel's weight depends on the type of produce, as it's a volume measurement. \"A bushel of tomatoes, for example, is supposed to weigh 56 pounds... Leaves and greens take up more space with less weight, so a bushel of spinach is only 20 pounds.\" It's all pretty complicated! Let's not bother with making a bushel-to-pound conversion, and instead price by the bushel. All this study of bushels of pumpkins, however, goes to show how very important it is to understand the nature of your data!\n",

    "## Visualization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the data scientist's role is to demonstrate the quality and nature of the data they are working with. To do this, they often create interesting visualizations, or plots, graphs, and charts, showing different aspects of data. In this way, they are able to visually show relationships and gaps that are otherwise hard to uncover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations can also help determine the machine learning technique most appropriate for the data. A scatterplot that seems to follow a line, for example, indicates that the data is a good candidate for a linear regression exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "One data visualization library that works well in Jupyter notebooks is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (which you also saw in the previous lesson).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "Get more experience with data visualization in [these tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/explore-analyze-data-with-python?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - experiment with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to create some basic plots to display the new dataframe you just created. What would a basic line plot show?\n",
