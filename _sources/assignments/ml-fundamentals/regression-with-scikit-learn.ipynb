    "Take a look at the [Linnerud dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud.html#sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud) in Scikit-learn. This dataset has multiple [targets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#linnerrud-dataset): 'It consists of three exercise (data) and three physiological (target) variables collected from twenty middle-aged men in a fitness club'.\n",
