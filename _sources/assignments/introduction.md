# Assignments

Ocademy sets up the assignment as [Test-driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) style. The questions are [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) alike, implemented as a bunch of Jupyter Notebooks, and fully automated through CI/CD. A real-world code quality assurance environment is simulated. You will learn how to handle software testing while working on the assignments.
