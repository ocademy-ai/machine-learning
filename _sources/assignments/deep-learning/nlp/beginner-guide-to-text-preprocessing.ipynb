    "Natural Language Processing is a subdomain under Artificial Intelligence which deals with processing natural language data like text and speech. We can also term NLP as the ‚ÄúArt of extracting information from texts‚Äù. Recently there has been a lot of activity in this field and amazing research coming out every day! But, the revolutionary research was the ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù which opened up avenues to build massive Deep Learning models which can come very close to human-level tasks like Summarization and Question Answering. Then came the GPTs and BERTs which were massive models consisting of billions of computation parameters trained on very huge datasets and can be fine-tuned to a variety of NLP tasks and problem statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep down, the roots of building a robust NLP model, Text Processing, plays a very important role. This might not be very evident in the recent models like BERT and GPT, but it is one of the most elementary processes in Natural Language Processing. All NLP researchers and enthusiasts will have done Text Processing more times than not while attempting to solve problems in this domain. For a beginner, Text Processing is a fundamental concept to be nailed before setting sights on solving advanced problems. This brings to a question‚Ää-‚ÄäWhy Text Processing?"

This process is called Encoding Technique and we have many techniques like CountVectorizer, Tf-Idf Vectorizer, Bag of Words, Word2Vec, GLoVe, etc. Popularly this process is also known as Text Representation. This comes after the Text Pre-Processing. We shall look into these techniques in the next article üôÇ\n",
