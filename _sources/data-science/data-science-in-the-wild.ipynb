    "# Data Science in the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost at the end of this learning journey!\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with definitions of data science and ethics, explored various tools & techniques for data analysis and visualization, reviewed the data science lifecycle, and looked at scaling and automating data science workflows with cloud computing services. So, you're probably wondering: _\"How exactly do I map all these learnings to real-world contexts?\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore real-world applications of data science across industries and dive into specific examples in the research, digital humanities, and sustainability, contexts. We'll look at student project opportunities and conclude with useful resources to help you continue your learning journey!\n",

    "## Data Science + industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the democratization of AI, developers are now finding it easier to design and integrate AI-driven decision-making and data-driven insights into user experiences and development workflows. Here are a few examples of how data science is \"applied\" to real-world applications across the industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google Flu Trends](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/can-learn-epic-failure-google-flu-trends/) used data science to correlate search terms with flu trends. While the approach had flaws, it raised awareness of the possibilities (and challenges) of data-driven healthcare predictions.\n",
    "* [UPS Routing Predictions](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/21/139000/how-ups-uses-ai-to-outsmart-bad-weather/) - explains how UPS uses data science and machine learning to predict optimal routes for delivery, taking into account weather conditions, traffic patterns, delivery deadlines, and more.\n",
    "* [NYC Taxicab Route Visualization](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/) - data gathered using [Freedom Of Information Laws](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/) helped visualize a day in the life of NYC cabs, helping us understand how they navigate the busy city, the money they make, and the duration of trips over each 24 hours.\n",
    "* [Uber Data Science Workbench](https://eng.uber.com/dsw/) - uses data (on pickup & dropoff locations, trip duration, preferred routes, etc.) gathered from millions of uber trips *daily* to build a data analytics tool to help with pricing, safety, fraud detection, and navigation decisions.\n",
    "* [Sports Analytics](https://towardsdatascience.com/scope-of-analytics-in-sports-world-37ed09c39860) - focuses on _predictive analytics_ (team and player analysis - think [Moneyball](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/moneyball-proves-importance-big-data-big-ideas/) - and fan management) and _data visualization_ (team & fan dashboards, games, etc.) with applications like talent scouting, sports gambling, and inventory/venue management.\n",
    "* [Data Science in Banking](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-in-banking/) - highlights the value of data science in the finance industry with applications ranging from risk modeling and fraud detection, to customer segmentation, real-time prediction, and recommender systems. Predictive analytics also drive critical measures like [credit scores](https://dzone.com/articles/using-big-data-and-predictive-analytics-for-credit).\n",
    "* [Data Science in Healthcare](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-in-healthcare/) - highlights applications like medical imaging (e.g., MRI, X-Ray, CT-Scan), genomics (DNA sequencing), drug development (risk assessment, success prediction), predictive analytics (patient care & supply logistics), disease tracking & prevention, etc.\n",

    "## Data Science + research\n",
    "\n",
    "While real-world applications often focus on industry use cases at scale, _research_ applications and projects can be useful from two perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _innovation opportunities_ - explore rapid prototyping of advanced concepts and testing of user experiences for next-generation applications.\n",
    "* _deployment challenges_ - investigate potential harms or unintended consequences of data science technologies in real-world contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For students, these research projects can provide both learning and collaboration opportunities that can improve your understanding of the topic, and broaden your awareness and engagement with relevant people or teams working in areas of interest. So what do research projects look like and how can they make an impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one example - the [MIT Gender Shades Study](http://gendershades.org/overview.html) from Joy Buolamwini (MIT Media Labs) with a [signature research paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf) co-authored with Timnit Gebru (then at Microsoft Research) that focused on,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What:** The objective of the research project was to _evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets_ based on gender and skin type. \n",
    "* **Why:** Facial analysis is used in areas like law enforcement, airport security, hiring systems and more - contexts where inaccurate classifications (e.g., due to bias) can cause potential economic and social harm to affected individuals or groups. Understanding (and eliminating or mitigating) biases is key to fairness in usage.\n",
    "* **How:** Researchers recognized that existing benchmarks used predominantly lighter-skinned subjects, and curated a new data set (1000+ images) that was _more balanced_ by gender and skin type. The data set was used to evaluate the accuracy of three gender classification products (from Microsoft, IBM & Face++).\n",
    "\n",
    "Results showed that though overall classification accuracy was good, there was a noticeable difference in error rates between various subgroups - with **misgendering** being higher for females or persons with darker skin types, indicative of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Outcomes:** Raised awareness that data science needs more _representative datasets_ (balanced subgroups) and more _inclusive teams_ (diverse backgrounds) to recognize and eliminate or mitigate such biases earlier in AI solutions. Research efforts like this are also instrumental in many organizations defining principles and practices for _responsible AI_ to improve fairness across their AI products and processes.\n",

    "## Data Science + humanities\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Humanities [has been defined](https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/about-dh-stanford) as \"a collection of practices and approaches combining computational methods with the humanistic inquiry\". [Stanford projects](https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/projects) like _\"rebooting history\"_ and _\"poetic thinking\"_ illustrate the linkage between [Digital Humanities and Data Science](https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/digital-humanities-and-data-science) - emphasizing techniques like network analysis, information visualization, and spatial and text analysis that can help us revisit historical and literary data sets to derive new insights and perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Want to explore and extend a project in this space?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out [\"Emily Dickinson and the Meter of Mood\"](https://gist.github.com/jlooper/ce4d102efd057137bc000db796bfd671) - a great example from [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper) that asks how we can use data science to revisit familiar poetry and re-evaluate its meaning and the contributions of its author in new contexts. For instance, _can we predict the season in which a poem was authored by analyzing its tone or sentiment_ - and what does this tell us about the author's state of mind over the relevant period?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we follow the steps of our data science lifecycle:\n",
    "* [**Data Acquisition**](https://gist.github.com/jlooper/ce4d102efd057137bc000db796bfd671#acquiring-the-dataset) - to collect a relevant dataset for analysis. Options include using an API (e.g., [Poetry DB API](https://poetrydb.org/index.html)) or scraping web pages (e.g., [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12242/12242-h/12242-h.htm)) using tools like [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/).\n",
    "* [**Data Cleaning**](https://gist.github.com/jlooper/ce4d102efd057137bc000db796bfd671#clean-the-data) - explains how text can be formatted, sanitized and simplified using basic tools like Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "* [**Data Analysis**](https://gist.github.com/jlooper/ce4d102efd057137bc000db796bfd671#working-with-the-data-in-a-notebook) - explains how we can now import the dataset into \"Notebooks\" for analysis using Python packages (like pandas, NumPy and matplotlib) to organize and visualize the data.\n",
    "* [**Sentiment Analysis**](https://gist.github.com/jlooper/ce4d102efd057137bc000db796bfd671#sentiment-analysis-using-cognitive-services) - explains how we can integrate cloud services like Text Analytics, using low-code tools like [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) for automated data processing workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this workflow, we can explore the seasonal impacts on the sentiment of the poems, and help us fashion our own perspectives on the author. Try it out yourself - then extend the notebook to ask other questions or visualize the data in new ways!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You can use some of the tools in the [Digital Humanities toolkit](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Toolkit) to pursue these avenues of inquiry\n",

    "## Data Science + sustainability\n",
    "\n",
    "The [2030 Agenda For Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda) - adopted by all United Nations members in 2015 - identifies 17 goals including ones that focus on **Protecting the Planet** from degradation and the impact of climate change. The [Microsoft Sustainability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability) initiative supports these goals by exploring ways in which technology solutions can support and build more sustainable futures with a [focus on 4 goals](https://dev.to/azure/a-visual-guide-to-sustainable-software-engineering-53hh) - being carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and bio-diverse by 2030.\n",
