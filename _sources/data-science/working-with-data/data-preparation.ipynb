    "# Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on its source, raw data may contain some inconsistencies that will cause challenges in analysis and modeling. In other words, this data can be categorized as “dirty” and will need to be cleaned up. This section focuses on techniques for cleaning and transforming the data to handle the challenges of missing, inaccurate, or incomplete data. Topics covered in this section will utilize Python and the Pandas library and will be [demonstrated in the notebook](../../assignments/data-science/data-preparation.ipynb) within this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The importance of cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of use and reuse**: When data is properly organized and normalized it’s easier to search, use, and share with others.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Data science often requires working with more than one dataset, where datasets from different sources need to be joined together. Making sure that each individual data set has common standardization will ensure that the data is still useful when they are all merged into one dataset.\n",
    "- **Model accuracy**: Data that has been cleaned improves the accuracy of models that rely on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common cleaning goals and strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploring a dataset**: Data exploration, which is covered in a [later section](../data-science-lifecycle/analyzing.md) can help you discover data that needs to be cleaned up. Visually observing values within a dataset can set expectations of what the rest of it will look like, or provide an idea of the problems that can be resolved. Exploration can involve basic querying, visualizations, and sampling.\n",
    "- **Formatting**: Depending on the source, data can have inconsistencies in how it’s presented. This can cause problems in searching for and representing the value, where it’s seen within the dataset but is not properly represented in visualizations or query results. Common formatting problems involve resolving whitespace, dates, and data types. Resolving formatting issues is typically up to the people who are using the data. For example, standards on how dates and numbers are presented can differ by country.\n",
    "- **Duplications**: Data that has more than one occurrence can produce inaccurate results and usually should be removed. This can be a common occurrence when joining two or more datasets together. However, there are instances where duplication in joined datasets contains pieces that can provide additional information and may need to be preserved.\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: Missing data can cause inaccuracies as well as weak or biased results. Sometimes these can be resolved by a \"reload\" of the data, filling in the missing values with computation and code like Python, or simply just removing the value and corresponding data. There are numerous reasons why data may be missing and the actions that are taken to resolve these missing values can be dependent on how and why they went missing in the first place.\n",

    "## Exploring DataFrame information\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Learning goal:** By the end of this subsection, you should be comfortable finding general information about the data stored in pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have loaded your data into Pandas, it will more likely than not be in a DataFrame(refer to the previous [section](./pandas.md) for a detailed overview). However, if the data set in your DataFrame has 60,000 rows and 400 columns, how do you even begin to get a sense of what you're working with? Fortunately, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) provides some convenient tools to quickly look at overall information about a DataFrame in addition to the first few and last few rows.\n",
