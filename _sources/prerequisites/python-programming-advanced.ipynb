    "A NAMESPACE is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are the set of built-in names (containing functions such as `abs()`, and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense, the set of attributes of an object also forms a namespace.\n",

    "\n",
    "By the way, we use the word attribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression `z.real`, `real` is an attribute of the object `z`. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression `modname.func_name`, `modname` is a module object and `func_name` is an attribute of it. In this case, there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace!\n",
