Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "- A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n",

Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like `append()` and `extend()`.\n",
