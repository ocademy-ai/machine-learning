    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is completely object-oriented, and not \"statically typed\". You do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "- A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n",

Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.
