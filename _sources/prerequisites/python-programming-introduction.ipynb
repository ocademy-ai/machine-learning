    "# Python programming introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open-source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language. Python was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. The name of the Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, Month Python's Flying Circus. The first version was released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy-to-learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- web development (server-side),\n",
    "- software development,\n",
    "- mathematics,\n",
    "- system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Python programming-related sections are designed for beginners and professionals who want to learn Python programming language. If you are in favor of videos, you may get started with this [Python for Absolute Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11OYpBrhdyM).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a programming language that is very close to human language and because of that, it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system administration, and Machine Learning libraries. Python is a highly embraced language in the data science and Machine Learning community. Hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a Python script you need to install Python. Let's [download](https://www.Python.org/) Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a windows user. Click the button encircled in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![installing on Windows](../../images/installing_on_windows.png)](https://www.Python.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a macOS user. Click the button encircled in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![installing on Mac](../../images/installing_on_macOS.png)](https://www.Python.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if Python is installed, write the following command on your device terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python Version](../../images/python_version.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the terminal, _Python 3.7.5_ version is used at the moment. Your version of Python might be different from mine, but it should be 3.6 or above. If you manage to see the Python version, well done. Python has been installed on your machine. Continue to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it does not need to be compiled. It means it executes the code line by line. Python comes with a _Python Shell (Python Interactive Shell)_. It is used to execute a single Python command and get the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Shell waits for the Python code from the user. When you enter the code, it interprets the code and shows the result in the next line. Open your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python Scripting Shell](../../images/opening_python_shell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write Python code(Python script). You will write your Python script next to this symbol >>> and then click Enter.\n",
    "Let us write our very first script on the Python scripting shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python script on Python shell](../../images/adding_on_python_shell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done, you wrote your first Python script on Python interactive shell. How do we close the Python interactive shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "To close the shell, next to this symbol `>>` write `exit()` command and press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Exit from the Python shell](../../images/exit_from_shell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you know how to open the Python interactive shell and how to exit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will give you results if you write scripts that Python understands, if not it returns errors. Let's make a deliberate mistake and see what Python will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invalid Syntax Error](../../images/invalid_syntax_error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the returned error, Python is so clever that it knows the mistake we made and which was `Syntax Error: invalid syntax`. Using `x` as multiplication in Python is a syntax error because `x` is not the valid syntax in Python. Instead of `x`, we use an asterisk `*` for multiplication. The returned error clearly shows what to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called _debugging_. Let us debug it by putting `*` in place of `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fixing Syntax Error](../../images/fixing_syntax_error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our bug was fixed, the code ran and we got the result we were expecting. As a programmer, you will see such kinds of errors on daily basis. It is good to know how to debug. To be good at debugging you should understand what kind of errors you are facing. Some of the Python errors you may encounter are `SyntaxError`, `IndexError`, `NameError`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, `KeyError`, `ImportError`, `AttributeError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError` etc. We will see more about different Python **_error types_** in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us practice more on how to use Python interactive shell. Go to your terminal or command prompt and write the word `Python`.\n",

    "The Python interactive shell is opened. Let us do some basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponential).\n",

    "Let us do some maths first before we write any Python code:\n",

    "- $ 2 + 3 = 5 $\n",
    "- $ 3 - 2 = 1 $\n",
    "- $ 3 * 2 = 6 $\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- `3 % 2 = 1` => which means finding the remainder\n",
    "- `3 // 2 = 1` => which means removing the remainder\n",
    "\n",
